            <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
            <p className='question'>a. The writer seems to believe that rural life is better than urban life. Do you agree with him?</p>
            <p>= Yes, I agree with the writer that rural life is better than urban life. First of all, the peaceful surroundings of the countryside attract me a lot. Villages are often described as quiet and calm places, perfect for relaxing and escaping the busy and stressful city life. Unlike cities, rural areas are less crowded with fewer people and vehicles. The natural beauty in villages is well preserved, allowing people to enjoy fresh air and a peaceful mind.</p>
            <p>This is very different from city life, where people often feel stressed and tired due to the fast pace and noise. The environment in rural areas is cleaner with less pollution because there are fewer factories and cars. While cities may offer better facilities and education, I believe that the advantages of living in the countryside such as fresh air, natural beauty, and calmness make rural life better overall.</p>

        <div>
            <p className='question'>b. Is the writer's way of looking at Bandipur just a gaze of an urban tourist? Why? Why not?</p>
            <p>= No, the writer's way of looking at Bandipur is not just the gaze of an urban tourist. He does not visit Bandipur simply as a casual traveler. Being tired of the hectic life in Kathmandu, he goes there with his friends to truly feel the peaceful environment and appreciate the natural beauty of the place with his heart.</p>
            <p>Bandipur is a hilltop town and a rural municipality in the Tanahu district of Nepal. It attracts visitors for many reasons. The genuine and original beauty of Bandipur draws most tourists, including the writer. While there, he and his friends are fascinated by the local culture, friendly people, and organic, delicious food.

He also learns about the local people and their tourism businesses. The writer spends some of his best moments in Bandipur, which shows that his experience is more meaningful than just that of a typical urban tourist.</p>
