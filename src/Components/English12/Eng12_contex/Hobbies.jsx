      <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
      <p className='question'>a. Do you believe the walking helps us understand ourselves? Give reasons in support of your opinion.</p>
      <p>= Yes, I believe that walking helps us understand ourselves better. Walking combines both physical and emotional benefits. It is a good form of exercise that also improves our mental well-being. Walking can reduce anxiety, depression, and negative moods, while boosting self-esteem and lessening feelings of social isolation.
</p><p>
Besides these benefits, walking helps clear our minds and encourages creative thinking. It allows ideas to flow freely and is a simple way to stay active while stimulating the brain. When we walk, we often connect with our inner selves reflecting on our actions, behavior, and feelings. This self-reflection helps us realize who we truly are.
</p><p>
Understanding ourselves means achieving self-awareness, which often happens when we are alone and surrounded by nature. Therefore, walking is a powerful way to understand ourselves deeply.</p>
<hr/>
      <p className='question'>b. Think of one of your hobbies. How does this hobby related to your psyche and self?</p>
      <p>= One of my favourite hobbies since childhood has been drawing and painting. I feel deeply connected to the things I create, as if I pour a part of myself into every stroke and color. Whenever I feel sad, happy, or even confused, I turn to drawing and painting to express my emotions. It is a way for me to communicate without words, and it often helps me understand my feelings better. This hobby also improves my concentration because when I focus on creating something, I pay close attention to small details like shapes, lines, and colors. This focus trains my mind to be patient and calm. Additionally, drawing and painting allow me to use my imagination freely. I can create worlds, scenes, or characters that exist only in my mind, which is very exciting and fulfilling. Sometimes, when life feels stressful or overwhelming, painting becomes a peaceful escape where I forget my worries and relax. This process refreshes my mind and makes me feel happier. Art has also helped me develop my creativity, which is useful in many parts of life beyond just drawing. I believe that this hobby has made me more observant, creative, and emotionally balanced. Overall, drawing and painting are not just activities for me, they are ways to connect with myself, explore my inner world, and bring joy and calm into my everyday life.</p>

      <p className='question'>c. Many people turn their hobbies into careers. Is it good to turn one's hobby into a career?</p>
      <p>= Yes, many people do turn their hobbies into careers, and this can be a wonderful opportunity for some. When you are passionate about something, making it your job can bring great satisfaction and motivation. Working on something you love can make your daily work enjoyable and fulfilling. However, turning a hobby into a career is a big decision and may not always be the best choice for everyone.
</p><p>
For some people, turning a hobby into a career can add pressure and stress. Hobbies are often a way to relax and escape from the busy routine of life. When a hobby becomes a source of income, it might lose its fun and feel like a burden or obligation. The creative freedom that once made the hobby enjoyable can be limited by deadlines, clients, or financial concerns.
</p><p>
Additionally, not all hobbies easily translate into stable careers. Sometimes, the business side of turning a hobby into a job, such as marketing, managing finances, and dealing with customers can be challenging and take away the joy.
</p><p>
In conclusion, if a person is truly passionate and ready to face the challenges, turning a hobby into a career can be very rewarding. But if it is done without careful thought or because of external pressure, it may lead to frustration and loss of enjoyment. So, it's important to weigh the pros and cons before making this big decision.</p>

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <p className='question'>Highlighting the advantages of walking, Henry David Thoreau says, “An early morning walk is a blessing for the whole day.” Write an essay on the advantages of morning walk.</p>
      <p>= In today's fast-paced world, many people face psychological problems, poor health, and constant mental tension. Life often becomes a mad rush from one task to another without any rest. Unfortunately, few people care for their health as much as they do for their daily work. However, there are simple ways to improve our health, and one of the best is taking a morning walk. Morning walks are so effective that they can help reduce many health problems and promote well-being.
</p><p>
From childhood, we have heard the saying, “Early to bed and early to rise makes a man healthy, wealthy, and wise.” This is not just a saying; it is true. Morning walks contribute greatly to making a person healthy and wise. Walking in the fresh morning air improves the physical condition of the body and strengthens the immune system, helping to protect us from many diseases.
</p><p>
Besides physical health, morning walks also create a sense of equality among people as they walk and interact in public spaces. It provides an opportunity to connect with nature and other people, which is good for mental health.
</p><p>
Most importantly, morning walks give energy for the whole day. They motivate us to avoid laziness and develop a positive mindset. Walking is especially good for the heart and other vital organs. It also offers a quiet time to think, relax, and plan the day ahead. According to research, the best time for a morning walk is between 3 pm and 7 pm, though early morning walks are still widely recommended for fresh air and a calm environment.
</p><p>
To sum up, morning walks are very important for maintaining a healthy body and mind. Everyone, whether young or old, should try to make morning walks a regular part of their daily routine. Studies have shown that people who walk regularly tend to live longer and healthier lives compared to those who do not. Therefore, a morning walk is truly a blessing for the whole day.</p>
