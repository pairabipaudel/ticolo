        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In his essay Human Rights and the Age of Inequality, Samuel Moyn explains that the modern human rights movement has done a good job protecting people from violence, torture, and unfair treatment by governments. It has helped promote freedom of speech, the right to a fair trial, and protection from abuse. However, he points out that this movement has not done enough to fight economic inequality, which means the large gap between rich and poor people.</p>
        <p>Moyn says that while human rights efforts have helped poor people survive, they have not done much to challenge the wealthy or change the unfair systems that keep the gap growing. In other words, the movement has focused on helping people live with dignity, but not necessarily helping them live equally.</p>
        <p>He also explains that around the same time the human rights movement became popular, another idea called neoliberalism grew. Neoliberalism supports free markets, privatization, and less government support. Since the human rights movement did not oppose this system, both ideas grew side by side, even though neoliberalism made the rich richer and left many people behind.</p>
        <p>In the end, Moyn believes that if the human rights movement wants to stay important, it needs to do more than protect people from harm. It should also work to make life fairer by fighting for equal wealth, opportunities, and living conditions. Helping people live freely is important, but helping them live equally is just as necessary.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following</p>
        <p>a. What is the first human rights declaration adopted by the United Nations?</p>
        <p>= The first human rights declaration adopted by the United Nations is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which was adopted in 1948. This declaration sets out a broad range of fundamental rights that every person is entitled to, including civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights. The UDHR was a landmark document aimed at promoting and protecting human dignity and freedom worldwide. It emphasized not only political and civil rights but also the importance of economic and social rights, such as the right to education, work, and an adequate standard of living. This declaration laid the foundation for many international human rights laws and agreements that followed.</p>
        <p>b. When is Human Rights Day observed?</p>
        <p>= Human Rights Day is observed every year on December 10th. This date was chosen to mark the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly in 1948. The day is dedicated to promoting awareness about human rights issues around the world and encouraging the protection and respect of the rights and freedoms that belong to every individual. Various events and activities take place globally on this day to highlight the importance of human rights and to remind governments and people of their responsibility to uphold them.</p>
        <p>c. What is the goal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights?</p>
        <p>= The goal of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is to ensure the most basic entitlements and essential values of human welfare and rights, such as equality, dignity, freedom, fairness, and respect. It aims to protect these rights for every individual simply because they are human. Additionally, the Declaration seeks to promote justice and peace worldwide by laying the foundation for freedom, fairness, and respect among all people.</p>
        <p>d. What are two big stages that involve writing the history of human rights about that of political economy?</p>
        <p>= The two major stages in writing the history of human rights in relation to political economy are the heroic age of national welfare that followed World War II and the period marked by bitter rivalry during the emerging Cold War era around 1948. The first stage focused on building social welfare and rights after the devastation of the war, while the second stage was characterized by intense ideological conflicts between opposing political blocs.</p>
        <p>e. What are the facts that have been missed in Roosevelt's call for a “second Bill of Rights”?</p>
        <p>= The facts missed in Roosevelt's call for a “second Bill of Rights” include that it marked a provincial and late entry of America into an already predetermined North Atlantic consensus. Instead of focusing on protecting the masses, his highest promise aimed at eliminating “special privileges for the few,” which created a ceiling on inequality rather than a safety net for all. Additionally, while Roosevelt hoped the rights would have global reach, the plan was organized on a national level rather than an international scale.</p>
        <p>f. Write the truth expressed in Herodotus's Histories.</p>
        <p>= The truth expressed in Herodotus's Histories is the importance of ensuring both global and local socio-economic justice. Achieving this justice would require redistribution of wealth from the rich to the poor, facilitated by new and innovative forms of legal activism.</p>
        <p>g. Why is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights important to you?</p>
        <p>= The Universal Declaration of Human Rights is important to me because it guarantees the basic rights of all human beings and promotes justice, equality, and fairness for everyone. Its purpose is to eliminate injustice, discrimination, inequality, and other inhuman behaviors from society, ensuring that every person is treated with dignity and respect.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. Does the essay give ways on how to stigmatize inequality? Explain.</p>
        <p>= The essay “Human Rights and the Age of Inequality” by Samuel Moyn discusses the importance of stigmatizing inequality but does not provide specific methods on how to do so. It explains that history shows some agents are not fearful enough to trigger redistribution, but as inequality worsens, opposition will inevitably arise. Therefore, justice and equality are essential demands. The essay suggests that a renewed human rights movement, representing the common people, can promote social equality and liberation. To achieve this, it is necessary to remove partiality and discrimination through proper supervision, monitoring, and strict laws. Inequality is considered a social stigma because it causes conflicts, so eliminating it is vital for the welfare of all.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. Is another human rights movement necessary? Why?</p>
        <p>= Yes, another human rights movement is necessary. As the essayist argues, current human rights frameworks are operating under political and economic suppression, and I agree with this view. Many individuals in positions of power continue to violate laws without consequences, and inequality remains deeply embedded in human affairs. Practices like nepotism and favoritism still hinder the emergence of new ideas and talents. Furthermore, political and social dominance by elite groups continues to suppress marginalized voices. Although laws and rights are documented, they are rarely enforced effectively. The division of society based on economic status such as rich and poor has created widespread injustice and inequality. Therefore, a new human rights movement is essential to address these systemic problems and ensure fairness and dignity for all.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. What are the challenges in maintaining human rights in Nepal?</p>
        <p>
            = Human rights are the basic freedoms and entitlements of every individual, protected by law and international agreements. In Nepal, efforts to institutionalize human rights began with the Human Rights Commission Act of 1997, and the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) became a constitutional body under the interim constitution of 2007. However, several challenges persist in maintaining these rights. Widespread poverty, especially in rural areas, limits access to basic needs and justice. Educational inequality and gender disparity continue to marginalize women and underprivileged communities. Health issues, children's rights violations, and abuse of authority further weaken the human rights landscape. Additionally, corruption, nepotism, and lack of legal enforcement obstruct the delivery of justice. Political instability and weak institutional frameworks hinder consistent implementation of policies. A lack of education and awareness about human rights among the general population also poses a significant barrier. As a result, despite legal provisions, practical enforcement of human rights in Nepal remains a significant challenge.
