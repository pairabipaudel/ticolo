        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The poem “Every Morning I Wake” is a short, meaningful, and emotional poem written by the famous Welsh poet Dylan Thomas. In this poem, the poet shares a very personal moment the quiet time when he wakes up every morning. It's not just about opening his eyes and starting a new day. For him, waking up is a spiritual act, a moment when he remembers God and feels deeply connected to the world around him.
</p><p>
Every day, as soon as he wakes up, the poet sends a prayer to God. But what makes this prayer special is that it's not only for himself. He doesn't just ask for his own happiness, safety, or success. Instead, he prays for everyone. He asks God to listen to the prayers of all people, even those who don't speak them out loud. He believes that people are suffering in different ways — some are poor, some are sick, some are lonely, and some are lost. Some may have even done bad things. But still, he hopes that God will be kind to them all.
</p><p>
The poet believes that everyone deserves mercy, care, and forgiveness, no matter who they are or what they have done. He sees the world as a place full of struggling people, and he wants God to hear them — not just those who go to church or pray out loud, but even those whose pain is silent. He knows that not everyone knows how to pray, or has the courage to ask for help, but they still need it. And so, he prays on their behalf.
</p><p>
This short poem is like a daily reminder a gentle push to be more caring, thoughtful, and loving towards others. It teaches us that every morning we should not just think about ourselves, but about others too. It shows us that the world is full of people who are silently hoping for someone to care about them, and that sometimes, a simple prayer can be an act of love.

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. When does the speaker pray to the Lord?</p>
        <p>= The speaker prays to the Lord every morning when he wakes up and every night before he goes to sleep.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. What does the speaker pray for?</p>
        <p>= The speaker prays that the Lord watches kindly over all the poor and weak creatures who live in the world. He asks for blessings and care for everyone, not just for himself.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Who are the 'poor creatures'? Why does the speaker call them 'poor creatures'?</p>
        <p>= The 'poor creatures' are all the innocent animals and people living on Earth. The speaker calls them 'poor creatures' because they are born to live, but they don't know if they will see another morning. Life is uncertain for them.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. What does Milk Wood sound like? A type of wood or a place? Why?</p>
        <p>= Milk Wood sounds like a place because there is no use of article before this noun. If it is a type of wood then an article either 'a', 'an' or 'the' must have been used according to grammatical rules.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Why do the inhabitants of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun 'but just for now'?</p>
        <p>= The people of Milk Wood bow to the setting sun "but just for now" because they know the day is ending. They are saying goodbye to the sun for the night and hoping to see it again the next day. They understand that life is not forever, so they pray to have another good day tomorrow.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Why does the speaker make a prayer to the God, but not to a king, a billionaire or a scientist?</p>
        <p>= The speaker prays to God because God is the creator of everything and everyone. God is very powerful and never dies. All people, even kings, rich people, and scientists, are made by God and they are not as powerful as Him. Kings, billionaires, and scientists are humans just like us, and they will also die one day. But God is forever and controls everything. That is why the speaker chooses to pray to God, not to a king, a billionaire, or a scientist.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. How does the rhyme scheme of the poem reinforce its message?</p>
        <p>= A rhyme scheme is how the ending sounds of lines in a poem match with each other. In this poem, the rhyme scheme is AABB. That means the first two lines rhyme, and the next two lines rhyme. This pattern makes the poem sound nice and easy to listen to. Since the poem is a prayer asking God to take care of all creatures, the gentle rhyme helps make the prayer feel kind and peaceful. The rhyme makes the poem more beautiful and helps show the loving message clearly.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Does the God exist? Give your opinion.</p>
        <p>People have been wondering for a very long time if God really exists. Some people believe in God, and some people don't. It depends on what each person thinks and feels. For me, I believe that God does exist. Even though we cannot see God with our eyes, I think God is like the air we breathe or the wind. We cannot see air, but we know it is there because we can feel it and it helps us live.
</p><p>
God is a special power that takes care of everything in the world. When good and surprising things happen, I believe it is because of God's help. God lives inside our hearts and minds. Sometimes, when people pray or need help, they feel that God is listening to them and helping them in some way.
</p><p>
So, even if we don't see God like we see other people or things, I believe God is always around us, watching over us and guiding us. That's why I think God really exists and is very important in our lives.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. In his Epistle to the author of the book, The Three Impostors (1768), Voltaire says, "Even if the God didn't exist, it would be necessary to invent him." Write an essay highlighting the importance of the God in the society.</p>
        <p>The Importance of God in Society
</p><p>
Voltaire once said, “Even if God didn't exist, we would need to imagine Him.” This means that whether or not we can see God, people need to believe in something bigger to help them live better. God is very important for many people and for society as a whole.
</p><p>
First, God helps people feel safe and happy. When we believe that God is watching over us and protecting us, we feel less scared and alone. This helps people to be brave and strong, especially when things are hard.
</p><p>
Second, God teaches us how to be good to one another. Most religions tell us to be kind, honest, and helpful. When people follow these rules, society becomes a better place. We learn to share, forgive, and love each other. This makes our communities peaceful and happy.
</p><p>
Third, believing in God helps people hope for better things. Sometimes life is difficult, and people face problems. When we trust God, we believe that everything will be okay in the end. This hope makes people keep trying and never give up.
</p><p>
Finally, God brings people together. Many people gather in places like churches, temples, or mosques to pray and celebrate. These gatherings help friends and families stay close and support each other.
</p><p>
In short, whether or not God is real, the idea of God helps people live kindly, feel hope, and work together. That is why God is very important in society.</p>
