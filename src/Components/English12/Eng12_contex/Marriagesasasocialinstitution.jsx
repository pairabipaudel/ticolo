These rules support the stability and purpose of marriage as a lasting union.</p>

        <p>= One of the central problems in modern society is setting proper and acceptable boundaries around the desires of modern individuals, such as the pursuit of well-being, comfort, luxury, and prestige.

        <p>g. What is normative marriage? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Normative marriage is a type of marriage that follows the established norms, values, and traditions of a society. It is considered a form of social control because it helps guide people's behavior and aspirations in an acceptable and structured way. This kind of marriage is more than just a private relationship between two people—it reflects the collective expectations of the community. For example, in the context of the United States, normative marriage is typically defined by six key features: it is entered into voluntarily by mature adults, involves a heterosexual couple, expects the husband to be the main earner, requires sexual faithfulness between the partners, and includes the expectation of parenthood. These characteristics distinguish normative marriage from other personal or intimate relationships, making it a powerful social institution.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the contex</h3>
        <p>a. Discuss six dimensions that define normative marriage in America.</p>
        <p>= In America, normative marriage is defined by six key dimensions that reflect the society's traditional values and legal expectations. First, marriage is considered a voluntary union, meaning both individuals must willingly agree to enter the relationship. Second, it is expected to be a heterosexual union between a man and a woman. Third, the husband is traditionally seen as the principal earner or provider for the family. Fourth, both partners are expected to remain sexually faithful to one another, upholding trust and commitment. Fifth, marriage is closely linked to parenthood, with the assumption that married couples will eventually have children. Lastly, even though many modern marriages may not strictly follow all these ideals, they continue to shape the core understanding of what marriage means in American society, as expressed in its laws, religion, and customs. These six dimensions collectively form the foundation of normative marriage and serve as a form of social guidance and control in people's lives.</p>

        <p>b. Do marriages differ according to culture? How is your marriage practice different from marriage in America?</p>
        <p>= Yes, marriage practices differ according to culture. Marriage is a social, spiritual, cultural, and legal union between a man and a woman as husband and wife. It also establishes a relationship between two families. The concepts and practices of marriage vary from place to place based on religion, tradition, and social values.

In the context of Nepal, where the majority of the population follows Hinduism, marriage is seen not only as a union between two individuals but also between two families. Hindu weddings are typically performed with the help of a priest (Pandit), either at home or in a temple. Important elements of a traditional Hindu wedding include the Sindur (vermilion powder) and Mangalsutra (sacred necklace), which symbolize the marital bond. After the ceremony, the bride traditionally goes to live in the groom's home. Most marriages are arranged by parents, with their involvement considered crucial throughout the process.

In contrast, marriage in America follows different cultural norms. The majority of the population practices Christianity, and Christian weddings usually take place in a church with a religious leader officiating the ceremony. The bride and groom exchange vows and rings, which symbolize their love and lifelong commitment. The ceremony often ends with a public kiss, marking the start of their relationship as husband and wife.

Another major difference is the concept of arranged vs. self-choice marriages. In Nepal, arranged marriages are common, and family involvement is strong. In the United States, individuals typically choose their own partners, and marriage may not always involve extensive family participation. Additionally, career and financial stability often take precedence over marriage in American society, whereas in Nepal, marriage is seen as a significant life event that is deeply respected and prioritized.

In summary, while the core idea of marriage as a union exists across cultures, the customs, rituals, and social importance of marriage differ significantly between Nepal and America.</p>

        <p>a. Write an essay on the marriage practice in your own culture.</p>
        <p>= Marriage Practice in My Culture

Marriage is the social, spiritual, cultural, and legal union between a man and a woman as husband and wife. In Nepal, a country rich in cultural diversity, marriage practices vary among different ethnic and tribal groups. However, the majority of marriages follow either Hindu or Buddhist traditions. I belong to the Hindu community, and in my culture, marriage is considered a sacred religious sacrament rather than just a social contract.

The wedding process begins with a pre-marriage ceremony called engagement, where the would-be bride and groom exchange rings and garlands in front of their families. The family priest (Pundit) recites Vedic mantras and conducts rituals to bless the union. The marriage date is usually fixed during this event.

On the wedding day, the groom's family, relatives, neighbors, and a traditional music band form a group known as the Janti and travel to the bride's house. Leading the Janti are women carrying beautifully decorated trays with food, gifts, and clothes for the bride's family, known as Saipata. A traditional musical group plays Panche Baja, a set of traditional Nepali instruments, creating a festive atmosphere. Behind them, the groom and his relatives dance and celebrate.

Upon arrival at the bride's home, the Janti is welcomed with great hospitality. The bride's family offers a special feast called Janti Bhoj to all the guests. The marriage rituals are conducted at a ceremonial space called Mandap or Jaggey, under the guidance of a Pundit (priest) who chants holy mantras from sacred scriptures.

One of the key moments of the ceremony involves the bride and groom circling a sacred fire seven times, with a knot tying them together — symbolizing their bond for seven lifetimes. The groom then applies Sindur (red vermillion powder) to the bride's forehead and places a Potey or Tilari (holy necklace) around her neck, signifying her status as a married woman.

Following the rituals, the bride's father washes the feet of the newlyweds, and relatives bless the couple with Tika on their foreheads and various gifts. The bride then leaves her parental home with the groom, accompanied by the Janti, dancing joyfully to the rhythm of Panche Baja.

At the groom's home, the couple is warmly welcomed. A traditional celebration known as Ratyauli is held, which includes singing, dancing, and joyful activities. It typically starts a day before the wedding and continues after the couple arrives.

Marriage, in my culture, is not just a union of two individuals but also of two families. It involves emotional, cultural, and spiritual bonding and is considered one of the most significant and festive events in a person's life. The married couple begins their new journey together, sharing love, responsibility, and cultural values for the rest of their lives.</p>

        <p>b. Is Marriage a Social Institution? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= Marriage is a social institution. It establishes a recognized and structured relationship between a man and a woman who make a long-term commitment to each other. As a social institution, marriage is not only personal and emotional but also legal, cultural, and spiritual. It has existed in every human society and continues to evolve over time, reflecting changes in societal values and norms.

From an emotional perspective, marriage is often based on romantic love and companionship. However, emotional connection alone is not sufficient. A successful marriage also involves realistic considerations such as financial stability, education, mutual understanding, and shared responsibilities. Couples need to be prepared to handle the challenges of family life, including raising children and managing a household. This practical aspect of marriage shows how deeply it is tied to social structures.

Marriage is a legally and socially approved relationship that grants the partners specific rights and duties. It offers sexual and economic benefits and is expected to be long-lasting. The married couple is allowed to live together and form a family without losing their social status. Marriage affects not only the couple but also the wider society, since the family is considered the basic unit of society. The values and lessons passed down through a family influence future generations and help maintain social order.

In Hindu culture, marriage is more than a social contract—it is a sacred bond. It is not seen as a response to human desire but as a path to spiritual development. The husband and wife are considered soulmates who support each other's moral and spiritual growth. Through the rituals and responsibilities of marriage, their energies are directed toward higher goals.

Marriage is considered an institution because it follows accepted rules, customs, and traditions that organize human relationships. These soft boundaries distinguish married couples from other types of relationships. Marriage provides a social framework where individuals can fulfill their emotional and physical needs while staying aligned with society's expectations. It helps maintain moral values and gives social recognition to the family unit.

In conclusion, marriage is undoubtedly a social institution. It is an essential part of society, regulating relationships, guiding behavior, and contributing to both personal fulfillment and the broader social order. Its importance has remained consistent throughout human history, even as its forms and meanings continue to evolve.
