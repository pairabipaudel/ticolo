        <h3>Comprehension</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why does Audre Lorde think that Mary got a sort of victory in the University of Boston?</p>
        <p>= Audre Lorde believes that Mary achieved a kind of victory at the University of Boston because she felt joyful and empowered to see many women actively participating in the speak-out event. The strong presence and shared energy of those women created a sense of unity and collective strength. This powerful gathering gave Mary and others like her the confidence, space, and support to grow, speak up, and feel a sense of belonging within a community of women.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Why is Lorde thankful to Mary?</p>
        <p>= Lorde is thankful to Mary because she gave her the book Gyn/Ecology, which she found powerful, thought-provoking, and helpful. The book gave her strength, inspired her, and supported her personal and intellectual growth.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What impression has the writer had about the way white women looked upon black women?</p>
        <p>= The writer had a negative impression of how white women viewed black women. She felt that white women often ignored black women's voices and failed to engage in meaningful dialogue with them. This lack of understanding and communication was long-standing and deeply discouraging for her.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Why did Mary not cast black women as goddesses in her book according to Lorde?</p>
        <p>= According to Lorde, Mary did not include black women as goddesses in her book because she consciously chose to focus only on the experiences and ecology of Western European women. This decision limited the representation of diverse cultural backgrounds.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. Why did Lorde think that she misused her words?</p>
        <p>= Lorde thought she misused her words because she used them only to defend herself as a woman of color, rather than opening up a dialogue or building understanding.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. For Lorde, how were women, especially from the black community, undervalued?</p>
        <p>= For Lorde, women especially black women were undervalued because they were ignored and isolated by white women who viewed everything through a narrow, patriarchal Western European perspective. This limited understanding kept black women marginalized and excluded.</p>

        <p className='question'>g. How does Mary take white women as? Does Lorde agree with Mary's view?</p>
        <p>= Mary sees white women as superior to non-white women. She assumes that the history and myths of white women are the only true sources of power and identity for all women, while non-white women's histories are seen as mere decorations or examples of victimization.</p>
        <p>No, Lorde does not agree with Mary's view. She rejects the idea of white feminism's superiority over black feminism and criticizes Mary for portraying black women as decorative and ignoring their real pain and struggles.</p>
        <p className='question'>h. What is Afrekete? How does it connect to this lesson?</p>
        <p>= Afrekete is the collective voice representing the tradition of Black lesbian writing. It connects to this lesson because the author uses Afrekete to unite and give voice to Black women within the broader field of Black literature, emphasizing their importance and visibility.</p>

            <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
            <p className='question'>a. "The oppression of women knows no ethnic or racial boundaries." Do you agree or not? Justify with your reasons.</p>
            <p>= Yes, I agree with the statement that the oppression of women knows no ethnic or racial boundaries.
</p><p>
Women have fought for equal treatment and equal pay for many years, but discrimination still exists worldwide. Men often receive better jobs, higher pay, and more respect, showing clear inequality. This ongoing discrimination creates intolerance and uncertainty among women who are denied their rightful rights.
</p><p>
Historically, women did not have equal rights, and this legacy continues to affect many societies today. Despite progress in gender equality, women still face violence, discrimination, and barriers to full participation in society. They are often seen as having lower social status than men, which is unfair. For example, many countries still deny women equal access to education because of cultural beliefs or financial difficulties.
</p><p>
Governments and social systems sometimes prevent women from achieving their goals, especially in poorer communities. Due to these challenges, women have suffered for ages, and their oppression crosses all ethnic and racial lines. No matter where they live or their background, many women continue to face inequality and injustice.</p>

            <p className='question'>b. Why is it important to question our beliefs and values? How are they set up in a person's mind?</p>
            <p>= It is important to question our beliefs and values because doing so helps us build character, honesty, compassion, acceptance, and strength. Many people avoid questioning their own beliefs because they fear it might weaken them. But this fear often shows that they already doubt their beliefs and are not being fully honest with themselves.
</p><p>
Questioning beliefs with objectivity looking at them as if from the outside helps us see whether our beliefs are true and what positive or negative effects they might have in the world. When we question others' beliefs, we should also reflect on our own. If we find that our beliefs are wrong, accepting this truth helps us grow and become stronger.
</p><p>
Our beliefs and values are shaped by experiences, culture, family, education, and society. They develop over time but should remain open to change through reflection and learning. Therefore, regularly questioning our beliefs is essential for personal growth and better understanding.</p>

            <h3>Writing</h3>
            <p className='question'>A. Have you ever faced or witnessed cases of racial or sexual discrimination? Write a short account.</p>
            <p>= Yes, I have faced and witnessed a lot of sexual discrimination. Some people may think that discrimination doesn't exist in today's world, but that is very wrong. It is still very common. Even in my own house, if there is some household work, my parents expect me to do it. If I don't want to do it, they say I need to learn because one day I will have to manage a home of my own. They expect me to handle all the household chores along with my education.
</p><p>
Also, if guests come to our house, it is my responsibility to take care of them and treat them well, even if I am sick. Although this is a smaller form of discrimination, it still shows how expectations on women are unfair.
</p><p>
I have also seen worse discrimination around me. For example, many girls are killed before birth, girls don't get quality education, they are not allowed to speak loudly, wear what they want, or make decisions for themselves. Often, they have to sacrifice their own happiness for others.
</p><p>
This shows how deep sexual discrimination is in society, and it is something we all need to fight against.</p>

            <p className='question'>B. Write an article for a national daily on "The Status of Women in Nepali Society."</p>
            <p>The Status of Women in Nepali Society</p>
            <p>Despite significant progress over the years, women in Nepal continue to face challenges that affect their status in society. Deep-rooted traditions and social norms often restrict women's access to education, healthcare, and equal job opportunities.</p>
            <p>In many rural areas, early marriage, limited schooling, and domestic violence remain serious issues. Women frequently bear the burden of household work alongside economic hardships. Gender inequality persists in various forms, limiting women's freedom and participation in public life.</p>
            <p>On the positive side, government initiatives and legal reforms have aimed to protect women's rights and promote gender equality. More girls are attending school, and women are increasingly visible in politics, business, and social activism.</p>
            <p>Still, changing long-held cultural beliefs and practices takes time. Continued efforts in education, awareness campaigns, and legal enforcement are essential to empower women and improve their status.</p>
            <p>To build a just and equal society, Nepal must ensure that women receive the respect, opportunities, and protection they deserve.</p>
