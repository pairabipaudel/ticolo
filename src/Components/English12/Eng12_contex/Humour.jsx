      <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>a. Do you agree that 'the couples, who laugh together, stay together?' Is it important for married couples to have the same sense of humour? Why?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I fully agree with the statement that “the couples who laugh together, stay together.” Laughter is one of the most powerful tools that can build connection, relieve tension, and create joyful memories in a relationship. In the context of marriage, where partners must navigate life's many challenges: financial issues, family responsibilities, health problems, and emotional ups and downs, a shared sense of humour can act as a bonding agent that keeps the relationship strong and light-hearted, even during hard times.</p>
        <p>Having the same sense of humour allows couples to understand each other's emotional responses, joke about situations instead of fighting over them, and avoid taking minor issues too seriously. When couples laugh together, they are not just enjoying a moment of happiness, but also releasing stress-reducing hormones like endorphins, building trust, and reinforcing emotional closeness. Shared laughter becomes a language of love that requires no explanation, just mutual enjoyment.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, scientific studies across cultures have shown that humour is considered an attractive and desirable quality in a romantic partner. It is not just about telling jokes or being funny, it's about being able to see the world in a similar, often playful, way. This compatibility in humour can be more significant than shared hobbies or interests, as it directly influences how couples deal with problems. For example, when both partners can find humour even in uncomfortable situations, they are less likely to argue destructively and more likely to recover quickly from disagreements.</p>
        <p>Moreover, humour fosters forgiveness and helps to diffuse anger or frustration. In a long-term relationship like marriage, where differences and disappointments are inevitable, being able to laugh together can help keep the emotional connection alive. It helps couples see each other as teammates rather than opponents, and reminds them not to take life or each other too seriously all the time.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, having a shared sense of humour is not just a nice addition to a relationship, but a vital part of maintaining emotional intimacy, reducing stress, and increasing relationship satisfaction. Couples who laugh together often communicate better, cope more easily with stress, and enjoy a deeper sense of companionship. So yes, it is not only important but highly beneficial for married couples to laugh together and share a similar sense of humour, it keeps their bond strong, happy, and long-lasting.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Some people believe that sometimes crying is good for health. Do you believe it? Give your reasons.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I believe that crying is good for our health. Crying is a natural way to express emotions like sadness, stress, pain, or even joy. When we cry, we release emotions that are built up inside us. This helps us feel lighter and more relaxed afterward. Instead of holding in our feelings, crying gives us a safe way to let them out.</p>
        <p>Many studies have shown that crying can reduce stress by releasing certain chemicals in the body that calm us down. People often feel better after crying because it helps clear their mind and heart. It is especially helpful during times of grief or emotional pain, like losing someone or facing a hard situation. Crying helps us face our feelings and slowly heal from within.</p>
        <p>Crying also helps others understand that we are struggling and need support. It can bring people closer and make emotional bonds stronger. In this way, crying is not a sign of weakness, it is a healthy and important part of emotional well-being. So yes, crying is good for our health both mentally and emotionally.</p>

      <h3>Writing</h3>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>A. Write a paragraph narrating an event from your life when you were involved contagious laughter.</p>
       <p>= One of the most unforgettable moments of contagious laughter in my life happened during a school picnic. We were playing a game where each person had to act out a funny scene without speaking. When it was my friend's turn, he tried to act like a clumsy old man slipping on a banana peel. His expressions and awkward movements were so hilarious that I couldn't stop laughing. Soon, others started laughing just by watching me laugh. Within minutes, the entire group was laughing so hard that some of us had tears in our eyes. Even the teachers nearby joined in. The best part was that no one really knew why we were still laughing, it had simply spread from one person to another like a wave. That day, I realized how powerful and joyful contagious laughter can be, and it still makes me smile whenever I think about it.</p>

        <p className='question'>B. Write a description of your favourite comedian explaining his/her personality, acting, performance and uniqueness.</p>
         <p>= My favourite comedian is Charlie Chaplin, one of the greatest and most influential figures in the history of film and comedy. He was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who became world-famous during the silent film era. He is best known for his role as “The Tramp”, a poor but kind and humorous character with a small mustache, bowler hat, and funny walk.</p>
        <p>Chaplin had a difficult childhood filled with poverty and struggle, yet these hardships shaped his personality and creative style. Despite facing many problems, he remained hopeful and used comedy to share his feelings with the world. He had a warm and expressive personality that helped him connect with people without using words. His silent performances were full of emotion, cleverness, and charm, which made people laugh and cry at the same time.</p>
        <p>What makes Charlie Chaplin truly unique is his ability to do everything in filmmaking he acted, wrote, directed, produced, and even composed music for his films. He was a perfectionist who paid great attention to every detail. His performances were not only funny but also meaningful, often sending a powerful message about life, poverty, love, and human kindness. His timeless films like Modern Times, The Kid, and City Lights still inspire millions. For all these reasons, I admire Charlie Chaplin as my favourite comedian.</p>
