        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In “Knowledge and Wisdom,” Bertrand Russell explains that knowledge means having lots of information, facts, and skills. It's about understanding how things work or knowing many details about the world. But wisdom is different, it's about knowing how to use that knowledge well in real life. Wisdom helps us understand what is truly important, how to live a good life, and how to make wise decisions.</p>
        <p>Russell points out that it's possible for someone to have a lot of knowledge but still lack wisdom. For example, a person might know many facts but fail to live happily or treat others kindly. On the other hand, someone with wisdom knows how to use their knowledge to live meaningfully and help others.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p >a. What are the factors that contribute to wisdom?</p>
        <p>= According to Bertrand Russell, several key factors contribute to the development of wisdom.
</p><p>
The first factor is a sense of proportion. This means the ability to consider all important aspects of a situation and to assign each factor the right level of importance. A wise person does not exaggerate minor issues or ignore major ones but maintains balance in judgment.
</p><p>
The second factor is awareness of the ends of human life. Russell argues that wise individuals reflect on the ultimate goals and purposes of human existence, such as happiness, justice, and the well-being of all. He illustrates this point by criticizing the philosopher Hegel, who, in Russell's view, failed to distinguish between power and moral good.
</p><p>
The third factor is emancipation from personal prejudices. To be wise, one must free themselves from narrow-minded views and emotional bias. While complete impartiality may be impossible, Russell believes that striving for objectivity is essential for wisdom.
</p><p>
Overall, wisdom involves not only knowledge but also the ability to apply it fairly, proportionally, and with a broader understanding of human life.</p>

        <p >b. What message does the writer try to convey with the example of technicians?</p>
        <p>= The writer wants to say that just having knowledge is not enough. Technicians know how to do things, but if they don't think about how their work affects people and the world, it can be dangerous.
</p><p>
He gives this example to show that wisdom is more important than knowledge. A wise person thinks about what is right and wrong and looks at the bigger picture. So, the writer is saying that we need both knowledge and wisdom to make the world a better place.</p>

        <p >c. Which leaders does Russell say were able to mix knowledge and wisdom soundly?</p>
        <p>= According to Russell, Queen Elizabeth I of England, Henry IV of France, and Abraham Lincoln of the USA were the leaders who mixed knowledge and wisdom well.
</p><p>
Queen Elizabeth I and Henry IV stayed away from the religious fights between Protestants and Catholics. Abraham Lincoln handled a big war wisely without losing his sense of right and wrong.</p>

        <p >d. Why is wisdom needed not only in public ways, but in private life equally?</p>
        <p>= Wisdom is important not only in public life but also in private life. In public life, it helps people avoid hatred and prejudice and makes them more understanding towards others. For example, two people may dislike each other because of misunderstandings, but wisdom can help them become friends. In private life, wisdom helps us make good decisions, choose the right goals, and avoid chasing impossible dreams. It also teaches us to be patient and calm in difficult times. That is why wisdom is equally needed in both public and private life.</p>

        <p>e. What, according to Russell, is the true aim of education?</p>
        <p>= According to Bertrand Russell, the true aim of education is to promote wisdom along with knowledge. He believes education should help people see things in relation to one another and understand the wider impact of their actions. Education should not just focus on facts and skills, but also teach love, understanding, and tolerance. Russell uses the parable of the Good Samaritan to show that we must love our neighbors, even those who may harm us. In his view, education should help people grow, develop good character, and contribute to the well-being of society.</p>
        <p>f. Can wisdom be taught? If so, how?</p>
        <p>= Yes, wisdom can be taught. According to Bertrand Russell, wisdom should be taught alongside knowledge as part of education. It can be done by encouraging moral understanding and teaching students to see things in relation to the world around them. Through stories like the Good Samaritan, students can learn the importance of love, compassion, and tolerance—even towards those who may have caused harm. Education should help people recognize the dangers of hatred and narrow-mindedness and promote the idea of being responsible, thoughtful, and global citizens.</p>
        <p>g. Why does the world need more wisdom in the future?</p>
        <p>= The world needs more wisdom in the future because, as knowledge and skills increase, so does the power to do both good and harm. Without wisdom, people may misuse knowledge and create conflict, hatred, or even destruction. Wisdom helps us overcome personal prejudices and ego, understand others, and live peacefully. It teaches us to think beyond ourselves and care for humanity. As the world becomes more complex, wisdom is essential to guide our actions and ensure that progress benefits everyone.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. According to Russel, “The pursuit of knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with wisdom.” Justify this statement.</p>
        <p>= According to Bertrand Russell, “The pursuit of knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with wisdom” because knowledge alone, without proper judgment and understanding, can lead to dangerous outcomes. In his essay Knowledge and Wisdom, Russell explains that knowledge is the collection of facts and information, while wisdom is the ability to use that knowledge wisely and responsibly for the well-being of all.
</p><p>
He uses the example of Hegel, a German philosopher, who had vast knowledge but lacked wisdom. Hegel's ideas made the Germans believe they were a superior race, which later contributed to war and destruction. This shows how knowledge, when not guided by wisdom, can promote harmful ideologies.
</p><p>
Russell argues that wisdom involves a sense of proportion, awareness of human values, and freedom from personal prejudice. It also means applying knowledge with kindness and care. Without wisdom, even skilled people like technicians or scientists may unintentionally cause harm to the world, especially with powerful technologies.
</p><p>
Thus, knowledge should not be pursued blindly. It must be balanced with wisdom to ensure it benefits humanity, promotes peace, and avoids harm.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>b. What, according to Russell, is the essence of wisdom? And how can one acquire the very essence?</p>
        <p>= According to Bertrand Russell, the essence of wisdom lies in freeing oneself from narrow personal interests and seeing life with a broader, more balanced perspective. He emphasizes that true wisdom involves understanding the long-term consequences of actions and being able to apply knowledge with compassion, fairness, and a sense of proportion.
</p><p>
Russell believes that wisdom comes when a person can rise above emotional and physical limitations and look beyond their personal desires. It also involves being free from personal prejudice, which helps make decisions that are less biased and more universally beneficial.
</p><p>
One can acquire the essence of wisdom not just through collecting facts, but through thoughtful reflection, real-life experience, and learning from both successes and failures. Wisdom grows as we practice using knowledge in ways that benefit others, not just ourselves. Therefore, wisdom is more than just knowing: it is about using what we know in a thoughtful, just, and meaningful way.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Why is wisdom necessary in education? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= Wisdom is necessary in education because it helps guide the use of knowledge in thoughtful and meaningful ways. While education provides us with facts, skills, and information, wisdom teaches us how to apply that knowledge responsibly and compassionately.
</p><p>
As knowledge and technology advance, the risks of misuse also increase. For example, someone may have the knowledge to build weapons or manipulate people, but without wisdom, they might use that knowledge to harm others. Wisdom helps us make ethical decisions, avoid prejudice, and consider the long-term effects of our actions.
</p><p>
In education, wisdom encourages students to look beyond personal gain and to think about how their actions affect others. It teaches empathy, patience, and understanding. It also helps individuals recognize their own flaws and learn from mistakes, leading to personal growth.
</p><p>
Therefore, education without wisdom is incomplete. To create a peaceful and just society, we need not just intelligent people, but wise ones—who know how to use knowledge for the betterment of all.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. How can you become wise? Do you think what you are doing in college contributes to wisdom?</p>
        <p>= To become wise, one must develop good judgment, self-awareness, and the ability to see things from different perspectives. Wisdom doesn't come overnight—it grows gradually through experience, reflection, and learning from both success and failure. A wise person remains calm during challenges, accepts their limitations, and tries to understand others. Making mistakes is part of the process, because each mistake teaches us something valuable.
</p><p>
Patience, positivity, and emotional control also play important roles. Staying hopeful, being kind, and solving problems without fear are habits that lead to wisdom.
</p><p>
Yes, I believe what I'm doing in college contributes to my wisdom. College is not just about gaining knowledge but also about learning life skills. When I manage my time, seek help when needed, listen to advice, plan my studies, and take responsibility for my actions, I'm practicing wisdom. These habits help me grow, not just as a student but as a person ready to handle life wisely.</p>
