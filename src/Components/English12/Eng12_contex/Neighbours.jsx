           <h3>Summary</h3> 
           <p>Neighbours is a short story written by Australian author Tim Winton in 1985. It appears in the book Migrants of Australia, edited by Harwood Lawler. The story centers around a newly married couple who have recently moved from the expansive outer suburbs to a multicultural and multilingual neighborhood.

Initially, the young couple feels uneasy and even disgusted by their new neighbors, many of whom are European migrants. For example, they are angered by the behavior of a Macedonian family next door and a Polish widower nearby. However, over time, the neighbors begin to help the couple—assisting with their kitchen garden and henhouse, among other things.

Gradually, the couple's attitude changes. They start talking and learning from their neighbors, discovering that these people are kind and supportive. When the young woman becomes pregnant, the neighbors celebrate with joy, offering gifts, advice, and help. This sense of community surprises the couple, especially the young man, who is deeply moved when the neighborhood warmly welcomes the birth of their baby boy.

The story highlights how people from different backgrounds, languages, and customs can live together happily and harmoniously. It emphasizes that human relationships and empathy are far more important than cultural differences or initial prejudices.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. Describe how the young couple's house looked like.</p>
        <p>=  The young couple's house looked like a small cottage, with its high ceilings and paned windows giving it an elegant and charming appearance. Although it was not luxurious or high-standard, it was cosy and perfectly suitable for a simple and comfortable life.</p>

        <p>b. How did the young couple identify their neighbors in the beginning of their arrival?</p>
        <p>= In the beginning, the young couple identified their neighbours by the sounds of spitting, washing, and daybreak watering. These unfamiliar habits made them feel like sojourners in a foreign land.</p>

        <p>c. How did the neighbors help the young couple in the kitchen garden?</p>
        <p>= The neighbours helped the young couple in the kitchen garden by advising them on spacing, hilling, and mulching. The Polish widower also helped the young man rebuild their henhouse. In addition, a large woman with black eyes and butcher's arms gave the young woman a bagful of garlic cloves to plant.</p>
        <p>d. Why were the people in the neighborhood surprised at the role of the young man and his wife in their family?</p>
        <p>= The people in the neighborhood were surprised because the young man stayed at home, working on his thesis and doing household chores, while his wife worked at a hospital and returned home late. This role reversal was unusual in their community, where it was uncommon for men to remain at home while women worked outside.</p>
        <p>e. How did the neighbors respond to the woman's pregnancy?  </p>
        <p>= The neighbours responded very positively to the woman's pregnancy. They smiled warmly and offered small gifts such as chocolates from the man in the deli and packets of cigarettes for her husband. During the summer, Italian women suggested baby names, while Greek women stopped her in the street, lifted her skirt to feel her belly, and predicted it would be a boy. By late summer, the woman next door had knitted a baby suit complete with booties and a beanie. Even the Polish widower was nearly finished building his two-car garage, showing the joyful and supportive atmosphere in the neighbourhood.</p>

        <p>f. Why did the young man begin to weep at the end of the story?</p>
        <p>= The young man began to weep at the end of the story because he was deeply moved by the unexpected kindness and support of his neighbours. When his baby was born, he saw a small group of tired but joyful faces cheering at the back fence. Their genuine happiness and warm response touched him emotionally, making him realise the strength of human connection beyond cultural and language differences.</p>
        <p>g. Why do you think the author did not characterize the persons in the story with proper names?</p>
        <p>= I think the author did not give the characters proper names because he wanted to present them as universal figures, not limited to a specific identity or background. By keeping them unnamed, the author highlights that the experiences of cultural misunderstanding, adaptation, and human connection are common to many people living in multicultural societies. This helps to convey the message that humanity, empathy, and community can exist despite differences in language, culture, and tradition.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. The story shows that linguistic and cultural barriers do not create any obstacle in human relationship. Cite some examples from the story where the neighbours have transcended such barriers.</p>
        <p>= The story "Neighbours" shows that linguistic and cultural differences do not prevent people from forming close, caring relationships. Feelings like love, respect, and kindness connect people beyond race, caste, language, nationality, or culture. Although the young couple initially misunderstood their neighbours because of different languages and customs, the neighbours helped them in many ways, showing that true humanity overcomes such barriers.

Some examples where the neighbours transcended linguistic and cultural differences are:

1. During autumn, while the young couple was planting vegetables and fruits in their kitchen garden, the neighbours gave helpful advice on spacing, hilling, and mulching. A large woman with black eyes and strong arms even gave them a bag of garlic cloves to plant.

2. The young couple exchanged gifts with their neighbours, offering heads of cabbage and receiving grapes and firewood in return.

3. In spring, the Macedonian family taught the couple how to slaughter, pluck, and dress poultry.

4. The Polish widower rebuilt the couple's falling henhouse without being asked, despite the language barrier.

5. When the neighbours learned about the woman's pregnancy, they gave gifts like chocolates and knitted a baby suit, and they joyfully celebrated the birth of the baby together. </p>

        <p>b. The last sentence of the story reads “The twentieth-century novel had not prepared him for this.” In your view, what differences did the young man find between twentieth-century novels and human relations?</p>
        <p>= In my view, the young man had expected, based on what he had read in twentieth century novels, that people would be selfish, indifferent, and isolated. He believed that in modern society, especially in urban or suburban settings, people were busy with their own lives and reluctant to help others. This expectation seemed true at first when he moved to the new multicultural neighborhood, where his neighbors seemed noisy, intrusive, and annoying.

However, reality proved to be very different from what he had imagined. Despite initial discomfort, when he and his wife needed help, their neighbors supported them generously and without hesitation. The neighbors advised them on gardening, helped rebuild the henhouse, and celebrated the woman's pregnancy by offering gifts and kindness. This warmth, cooperation, and genuine human connection deeply touched the young man and challenged his preconceived ideas.

Thus, the “twentieth century novel” which portrayed people as selfish and disconnected had not prepared him for the real experience of human relationships full of empathy, community, and support. The young man realized that intolerance and prejudice stem from ignorance, and that genuine human relationships can overcome cultural and linguistic differences to build a caring community. This discovery was a powerful lesson that changed his outlook on life and people.</p>

        <p>c. A Nepali proverb says “Neighbors are companions for wedding procession as well as for funeral procession.” Does this proverb apply in the story? Justify.</p>
        <p>= Yes, this proverb applies perfectly to the story. Neighbours are true companions in life who share our experiences in both happy and difficult times. They are needed at every step of life, whether during moments of joy or sorrow. They accompany us during celebrations like weddings and also support us during sad occasions like funerals.

In the story, the neighbours are actively involved in various events of the young couple's life. The story mainly focuses on three close neighbours who live their lives by sharing, caring, and helping each other. For example, during the young woman's pregnancy, the neighbours cared for her, reassured her, and gave gifts. The neighbours are shown spending time teaching each other, enjoying conversations, and living together in a supportive community.

This involvement and support show that the neighbours in the story truly embody the meaning of the proverb, being companions in both joyful and difficult times. They make life easier and happier for the couple, just as the proverb suggests.</p>

        <p>d. The author has dealt with an issue of multiculturalism in the story. Why do you think multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world?</p>
        <p>= Multiculturalism refers to how a society manages cultural diversity, both at the national and community levels. It can arise naturally through immigration or artificially when different cultural groups are combined within one jurisdiction.

I think multiculturalism has become a major issue in the present world because, while it brings people from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds together, it also creates various social challenges. These include difficulties in assimilation, ethnic segregation, and adaptation problems such as school dropouts, unemployment, and increased crime rates. Migration has accelerated multiculturalism as people move across countries seeking better opportunities, resulting in culturally diverse populations living closely in cities and regions.

Due to this diversity, many neighbors often do not know each other well, and the traditional bonds of love, compassion, and close relationships between neighbors, which were common in the past, tend to weaken in the present day.

However, multiculturalism also has positive aspects. With advances in communication technology and globalization, the world has become a global village where different cultures share socioeconomic ideas, beliefs, and experiences. When there is mutual understanding and respect, multiculturalism can enrich society by fostering cultural pluralism and reducing discrimination and oppression.

Countries like the UK, the USA, and Australia have embraced multiculturalism by welcoming immigrants from diverse backgrounds, creating unique multicultural and multilingual communities. Therefore, although multiculturalism presents challenges, it also offers opportunities for social and economic development, making it a significant and complex issue in today's world.

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. Write an essay on Celebration of Childbirth in my Community.</p>
        <p>= Childbirth is a special event that is celebrated with great joy and cultural rituals in my community. My community is predominantly Hindu, with castes like Brahmin, Chhetri, Newar, and Magar. In Hindu culture, a newborn child is considered a divine gift. Girls are especially revered as goddesses—symbolizing Laxmi (goddess of wealth) and Saraswati (goddess of knowledge). Many auspicious events begin by worshipping girls.

When a child is born, the family receives warm congratulations from relatives and neighbors. The first important ceremony occurs on the sixth day, known as Chhaiti. It is believed that on this night, God visits to write the child's fate. A lamp is kept burning throughout the night, and a pen and paper are placed under the baby's pillow as part of the ritual.

The next ceremony takes place on the eleventh day, called Nwaran, or the naming ceremony. On this day, the child receives a name based on astrological beliefs. Another significant event is the rice-feeding ceremony (Pasni), which is held when the child is around five to six months old. During this celebration, the baby is fed solid food, usually rice, for the first time. The family invites relatives and friends to take part in the joyous occasion.

In summary, childbirth is not just a family event but a community celebration in my culture. These traditions bring people together and strengthen social bonds, making childbirth a sacred and joyous moment for everyone involved.</p>

        <p>b. Do the people in your community respond with similar reactions upon the pregnancy and childbirth as depicted in the story? Give a couple of examples.</p>
        <p>= In the short story “Neighbours”, the entire neighborhood reacts with warmth and excitement upon learning about the woman's pregnancy. Despite coming from different cultural backgrounds, the neighbors offer advice, give gifts, and support the couple during the pregnancy and childbirth. This positive response is a central theme of the story.

In urban areas of my community, such warm and collective responses are less common. People often remain busy with their personal lives and have limited interaction with neighbors. While close friends and family may celebrate the event, most neighbors do not actively participate or offer help unless there is a strong personal connection. Many people have become self-centered and rarely engage in others' family matters.

However, in rural areas, the reaction is quite similar to what is described in the story. When a woman becomes pregnant, neighbors often visit to offer support, share advice, and even help during labor. They see childbirth as a divine blessing and take part in the celebrations like Chhaiti, Nwaran, and Pasni. The entire community feels involved, and such traditions create a strong sense of unity and happiness.

In conclusion, while city life may lack such neighborly bonding, village communities still reflect the spirit shown in the story “Neighbours”. The celebration of childbirth continues to be a vital and cherished part of cultural life in rural Nepal.</p>
