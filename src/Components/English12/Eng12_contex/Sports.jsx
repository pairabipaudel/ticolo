      <div>
        <hr/>
        <p className='question'>B. Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. What does the reporter say that England is waiting to heal its half-century long pain?</p>
        <p>= The reporter says that England is waiting to heal its half-century-long pain because England has not won any major international football title since their first and only World Cup win in 1966. This long period without a trophy has caused disappointment, and England is eager to overcome this and win again.</p>
        <p>b. How did the Italian players react as soon as they became the champions?</p>
        <p>= The Italian players reacted to becoming champions by celebrating joyfully with their fans, running and diving to the ground in excitement. At the same time, some of them shouted into a TV camera, mocking England's anthem by saying, “It's coming, Rome,” instead of England's “It's coming home.”</p>
        <p>c. Why did Saka and Sancho cry?</p>
        <p>= Bukayo Saka and Jadon Sancho cried because they missed their penalties in the shootout during the Euro Cup 2020 final, which led to England losing the match against Italy. Their missed penalties caused great disappointment and sadness</p>
        <p>d. Penalty shoot-out has long been a bitter experience for the English team. Why?</p>
        <p>= Penalty shoot-outs have been a bitter experience for the English football team because they have lost several important matches in major tournaments due to missed penalties. In years like 1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006, and 2012, England faced heartbreak by losing in penalty shootouts, which caused repeated disappointment for the team and fans.</p>
        <p>e. State the contribution of Roberto Mancini to the Italian football.</p>
        <p>= Roberto Mancini made a huge contribution to Italian football by transforming the team from a low point when they failed to qualify for the World Cup into the best team in Europe. Under his leadership, Italy set a national record of 34 unbeaten games. Mancini brought great confidence, strong guidance, and teamwork to the squad which helped Italy win the Euro Cup 2020, adding to the country's prestigious football history.</p>
        <p>f. How does the Euro Cup final 2020 remind the audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals? How?</p>
        <p>=The Euro Cup Final 2020 reminds audiences of the 2018 World Cup semifinals because in both matches, England scored early but then had to spend most of the game chasing their opponent's midfield. In 2018, England scored early against Croatia but struggled to control the midfield and eventually lost in extra time. Similarly, in the Euro Cup final, Italy's midfield controlled the game, forcing England to defend deeply, just like Croatia did in 2018. This similar strategy made the 2020 final feel like a repeat of that earlier match.</p>

      <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
      <p className='question'>a. "Every match is a new opportunity. Put its faliure behind and start over again." Does this apply to the Italian football team when we analyse their performance from their failure to qualify for the World Cup Football to their victory in the European Championship in these four years?</p>
      <p>= Yes, the statement "Every match is a new opportunity. Put its failure behind and start over again" perfectly applies to the Italian football team's journey from failing to qualify for the World Cup to winning the European Championship in four years.
</p><p>
After the shocking failure to qualify for the World Cup, which marked their lowest point in decades, the Italian team did not lose hope. Instead, they focused on learning from their mistakes, improving their strategies, and building strong teamwork under the guidance of coach Roberto Mancini. The team kept working hard, showing great determination and unity, turning setbacks into motivation.
</p><p>
During these four years, Italy transformed its football culture and team spirit. They improved their gameplay, developed excellent management and strategy, and overcame their past failures. This hard work paid off when they won the Euro Cup 2020, proving that failure was only a stepping stone to their success.
</p><p>
Their journey shows how resilience, learning from mistakes, and continuous effort can lead to great achievements. Italy's comeback is an inspiring example of how putting past failures behind and starting fresh can lead to triumph.</p>
<hr/>
      <p className='question'>b. When a team plays in a home ground, it gets a huge support from the audience in the stadium. Does this support them to win the match or the players may feel pressure to win and thus lose? What do you think?</p>
      <p>= I think playing at the home ground with a supportive audience has both advantages and disadvantages for a team. On one hand, the players feel more confident and motivated because their fans cheer for them, creating a positive and energetic atmosphere. Being familiar with the home ground conditions like weather and pitch also helps the players perform better.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the pressure to win in front of their home crowd can sometimes be too much. Players might become nervous or overexcited, which can cause mistakes and lead to losing the match. The expectations from fans can make players feel stressed rather than supported.
</p><p>
For example, in the Euro Cup 2020 final, England played on their home ground but lost to Italy. The pressure from their fans and the long wait to win a major trophy since 1966 may have added to their stress, which affected their performance in the penalty shootout.
</p><p>
In conclusion, while playing at home usually supports the team by boosting confidence and morale, it can also create pressure that may negatively affect players. So, home advantage is not always a guarantee of winning; it depends on how the players handle the pressure and use the support.</p>

      <p>=Argentina beat Brazil to win Copa America</p><p>
By Reuters</p><p>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 10</p><p>

Argentina ended a 28-year wait for a major title on Saturday as Angel Di Maria's goal secured a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the Copa America final. This triumph gave Argentina their 15th Copa America trophy, equaling Brazil's record.
</p><p>
The win was especially significant for Lionel Messi, who earned his first major international medal in the iconic blue-and-white shirt after years of club and individual successes.
</p><p>
Di Maria, starting only his second match of the tournament, justified his selection by scoring the decisive goal midway through the first half.
</p><p>
Brazil increased their pressure in the second half, playing aggressively and fielding five strikers in an effort to find an equalizer. However, Argentina's defense, led by the outstanding Rodrigo De Paul, held firm to preserve the clean sheet.
</p><p>
Brazilian defender Thiago Silva praised Argentina's performance, saying, "First we have to congratulate our opponents, especially for the first half when they neutralized us."
</p><p>
Argentina's tactical discipline and resilience ensured their historic victory against their fierce rivals on home soil.</p>

        <p className='question'>C. We can see many countries competing to host the great international sport events like the World Cup Football. But, there are arguments that hosting an even like WOrld Cup Football can have more problems than benefits. What do you think? Write your arguments in favour or against hosting an international sport event in about 500 words.</p>
        <p>=Many countries around the world compete eagerly to host prestigious international sports events such as the World Cup Football. While these events bring global attention and national pride, there is ongoing debate about whether the benefits truly outweigh the challenges. In this essay, I will present arguments both in favor of and against hosting such events and conclude with my perspective.
</p><p>
One of the most important advantages of hosting an international sports event is the prestige it brings to the host country. Becoming the center of global attention for weeks or even months is a matter of great pride, not only for the nation but also for its citizens and neighboring countries. Hosting the World Cup or similar tournaments allows a country to showcase its culture, hospitality, and organizational abilities on an international stage. This positive exposure can improve the country's image worldwide.
</p><p>
Moreover, these events generate significant revenue through tourism. Sports fans, journalists, and teams from all over the world visit the host country, which increases demand for hotels, transportation, restaurants, and other services. The government benefits economically by issuing tourist visas and collecting taxes from increased business activities. The improvements made in infrastructure—such as stadiums, roads, airports, and public transport—not only serve the event but also contribute to the country's long-term development by enhancing the daily life of residents and boosting future tourism.
</p><p>
International tournaments also provide athletes and sports enthusiasts opportunities to learn new skills, exchange cultural values, and build international friendships. Such events become platforms for cultural exchange, encouraging goodwill among nations, which can have positive effects beyond the sporting world.
</p><p>
However, hosting large-scale events requires massive financial investment. The costs of building or renovating stadiums, improving infrastructure, and ensuring security can run into millions or even billions of dollars. This money might be better spent on more urgent social sectors like healthcare, education, or poverty alleviation, which directly improve citizens quality of life.
</p><p>
Furthermore, governments often face budget overruns and financial deficits as preparations progress. Many host countries have experienced financial difficulties and even insolvency due to overspending. The pressure to provide world-class facilities sometimes forces governments to divert resources away from everyday needs, causing dissatisfaction among the public.
</p><p>
There are also concerns about the sustainability of these investments. Stadiums built specifically for the event may remain underused or abandoned afterward, becoming financial burdens rather than assets. The environmental impact of large-scale construction and the influx of visitors can also cause long-term damage if not managed responsibly.
</p><p>
Despite these challenges, hosting an international sports event can stimulate foreign investment, create employment, and boost national morale. The key lies in careful planning and sustainable strategies to ensure the event leaves a positive legacy rather than a financial drain.
</p><p>
Conclusion
</p><p>
To conclude, hosting international sports events like the World Cup has both significant benefits and notable drawbacks. While the financial cost and risk of mismanagement are real concerns, the prestige, economic opportunities, improved infrastructure, and cultural exchange offered by these events often outweigh the disadvantages. With careful planning, responsible management, and a focus on sustainability, countries can maximize the advantages of hosting and minimize the potential problems.</p>
