        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The poem “I Was My Own Route” is a powerful expression of independence and self-discovery. The speaker tells us about their journey of choosing their own path in life instead of following the one that others expected or planned for them. This path wasn't easy, it was full of challenges, loneliness, and pain. But despite these difficulties, the speaker feels proud because they made the choice to live authentically, true to themselves.</p>
        <p>In the poem, the speaker talks about how society often tries to put people, especially women, into fixed roles or boxes. These roles expect people to be quiet, obedient, and follow traditions without question. But the speaker refuses to accept this. They want to be free from the rules that try to control them and instead embrace their own identity and dreams.</p>
        <p>The poem also shows the struggle between the comfort of the familiar and the risk of choosing something new and uncertain. Even though leaving behind the past can be painful, the speaker believes that being true to oneself is worth the sacrifice. They find strength in their independence and encourage others to be brave and follow their own hearts.</p>
        <p>Overall, the poem inspires readers to have courage, to break free from limitations set by society, and to create their own unique path in life. It celebrates freedom, self-respect, and the journey toward discovering who we really are.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why did the speaker try to be the way men wanted her to be?</p>
        <p>= The speaker tried to be the way men wanted her to be because she wanted to be free and strong. She did not like how men wanted women to just obey and stay quiet. She wanted to change that and show that women can be independent and make their own choices. She didn't want to be controlled by men's rules.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. What do you understand by her feet 'would not accept walking backwards'?</p>
        <p>= The line “her feet would not accept walking backwards” means she did not want to go back to the old days when women had to stay quiet and obey men. She wanted to move forward and be free, strong, and equal like men. Her feet not walking backwards show she wanted to keep going ahead and not stay behind.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Who are the old guards? Why did they grow desperate?</p>
        <p>= The “old guards” are the people who believe that men should be in charge and women should be quiet and follow rules made by men. They think women are not as important as men. They became desperate and worried because Julia wanted women to be free, strong, and equal. She wanted to change the old rules, and that scared the old guards.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. How did the speaker have 'a feeling of intimate liberation'?</p>
        <p>= The speaker felt a special kind of freedom inside her because she kept moving forward on her own path, even when it was hard. She didn't stop even when the old rules made by men tried to hold her back. By choosing her own way, she felt more free and strong inside.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Why did the speaker's desire to follow men warp in her?</p>
        <p>= The speaker wanted to follow what men wanted at first, but then her feelings changed because she saw that men had many strict rules for women. She didn't like those rules because they stopped women from being free and happy. So, her wish to follow men got twisted or changed, and she wanted to be strong and free instead.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What does the speaker mean when she says she was playing a game of hide and seek with her being'?</p>
        <p>= When the speaker says she was playing a game of hide and seek with her being, she is using a fun game to explain something serious about herself. You know how in hide and seek, one person closes their eyes and counts while the others hide? Then the seeker tries to find them. Sometimes it's hard to find your friends because they are hiding very well.
</p><p>
In this poem, the speaker feels like she is hiding from herself or hiding her true self. She wants to be free and do what she really wants, but the rules made by men don't allow her to be who she truly is. The men in her world want her to behave in a certain way — to be quiet, obedient, and follow their instructions. But the speaker doesn't want to follow those old rules because she believes women should be free, independent, and equal.
</p><p>
So, she is playing hide and seek with her “being,” which means she is sometimes showing her true self and sometimes hiding it because she has to follow what others want. It's like she is trying to protect her real feelings and dreams by hiding them, hoping one day she can be fully herself without fear. This game of hide and seek shows her struggle to find freedom and express who she really is in a world that tries to hold her back.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <p className='question'>b. Why, in your view, was her back ripped by the old guards as she was advancing forward?</p>
      <p>= When the speaker says her back was ripped by the old guards as she was moving forward, she means that the people who wanted to keep women down tried to stop her. The "old guards" are like strict and stubborn people who believe women should not be free or independent. They want women to follow old rules and stay quiet.
</p><p>
As the speaker tried to walk forward on the path of freedom and equality for women, these old guards didn't like it. They got scared and angry because change can be hard for some people. So, they tried to push her back and stop her from moving ahead. It's like when you try to walk forward but someone pulls you backward.
</p><p>
They made things difficult for her by saying mean things, stopping her from doing what she wants, or making rules to keep women under control. This is why she felt pain — her “back was ripped” — because the old guards were fighting hard to keep things the same and not let women be free.
</p><p>
Even though it was painful and hard, she didn't stop. She kept moving forward because she believed in freedom and equality for all women. This shows how brave and strong she was to face problems and keep trying to make the world a better place for women.</p>
<div>
  <hr/>
    <p className='question'>c. What, according to the speaker, did it feel like to be free?</p>
    <p>= According to the speaker, feeling free was a wonderful and special feeling. It was like getting a very precious gift called liberation. Being free meant she could be herself without anyone telling her what to do or how to behave just because she was a girl.
</p><p>
She felt like she had her own identity—she was her own boss. She didn't have to ask for permission or follow strict rules made by men that kept women from doing many things. She could speak up, make choices, and live happily in her own way.
</p><p>
Being free was like having wings to fly wherever she wanted. It gave her power to chase her dreams and stand up for women's rights, freedom, and independence. It was a feeling of joy and strength because she was no longer controlled or limited by unfair rules.
</p><p>
In short, freedom was like breaking chains that held her back and stepping into a bright, new world full of hope and possibilities.</p>
</div>
<hr/>
<div>
    <p className='question'>d. Why does the speaker prefer the present to the past?</p>
    <p>= The speaker likes the present more than the past because her past was full of problems and sadness. When she was younger, she had to suffer because men had too much control over women's lives. Her family also had many difficulties, and even one of her brothers or sisters died because they didn't have enough food. She lived in a world where women didn't have many rights and had to follow strict rules made by men.
</p><p>
But now, in the present, things are much better for her. She has become a strong and brave woman who leads the way for other women to be free and live their own lives. She has shown other women that they can be independent and follow their dreams.
</p><p>
Because of this, she feels proud of herself and happy about the present. She wants to forget the bad times of the past and enjoy the good things happening now. So, she prefers the present because it gives her hope, freedom, and happiness.</p>

<div>
    <p className='question'>e. John Donne, in his poem “No Man is an Island”, says, “No man is an island entire of itself.” Would Burgos agree with Donne? Do you agree with Donne or Burgos?</p>
    <p>= John Donne was a famous poet from a long time ago. He said, “No man is an island,” which means no person can live alone without help from others. People need each other to be happy and to live good lives. He believed that everyone, whether a man or a woman, is important and part of one big family—humanity.
</p><p>
On the other hand, Julia de Burgos, the speaker in the poem, talks a lot about women's rights. She wanted women to be free from the control of men and to live their own lives. She didn't want to follow what men said, because in her time, women were treated unfairly. So, her words may sound like she wants to live without men, but she was really just fighting for equal rights.
</p><p>
If we think about it, both Donne and Burgos are right in their own ways. Donne reminds us that we need each other. Burgos reminds us that everyone, including women, should be free and respected.
</p><p>
I agree with both: people should support each other like Donne said, but also treat each other equally and fairly like Burgos wanted. Boys and girls, men and women, all matter the same. Together, with fairness and teamwork, the world becomes a better place.</p>

    <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
    <p className='question'>a. Write an essay on My Idea of Freedom.</p>
    <p>
My Idea of Freedom</p><p>
For me, freedom means being able to live my life in a way that makes me happy. It means I can speak, learn, and choose things for myself. I think freedom is important because it helps people grow, dream, and feel safe.
</p><p>
When I think about freedom, I imagine being able to do the things I enjoy, like going to school, playing with friends, and having time to relax. I can share my thoughts, ask questions, and try new things without being afraid. That's what freedom feels like to me.
</p><p>
If we didn't have freedom, life would be very hard. We might be told what to do all the time. We wouldn't be able to choose what we want to study, where we want to go, or even what we believe. That would make me feel trapped and unhappy.
</p><p>
I'm glad I live in a place where I have freedom. It means I can dream big, make mistakes, and try again. Everyone should have the chance to live freely, as long as they also respect others.
</p><p>
In the end, freedom helps us become kind, smart, and strong people. It is not just about doing whatever we want, but about having the chance to live a good life, make our own choices, and care for others too.</p>

<div>
    <p className='question'>b.Not all people, however, seem to agree with the kind of freedom upheld by Burgos in this poem. For example, William Faulkner, in his novel Requiem for a Nun, says, ""The past is never dead. It's not even past. All of us labor in webs spun long before we were born, webs of heredity and environment, of desire and consequence, of history and eternity." Do you agree with Faulkner? Why? Why not?

</p>
<p>= Yes, I agree with William Faulkner. I think the past is still part of our lives, even if we don't always see it.
</p><p>
Faulkner says, “The past is never dead. It's not even past.” That means things that happened before like how our parents raised us, what kind of family we were born into, or what kind of country we live in still affect us today. For example, if someone's grandparents had a hard life, that might still affect their family now.
</p><p>
Julia de Burgos, in her poem, talks about wanting to be free from what other people tell her to do, especially men. She wants to live her own life. That's a strong and powerful idea! But Faulkner reminds us that even when we try to live freely, the past still pulls on us like a spider web. We're connected to it.
</p><p>
So, I think both of them are right. Julia wants to move forward and be free, and that's important. But Faulkner is right too—the past is still with us, and we have to understand it if we want to make a better future.
</p><p>
In the end, we can learn from the past and still follow our dreams.</p>
