        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>This poem is about how a day starts and ends, but it's also a metaphor for life. The first part describes sunrise in a really pretty way, the sun comes up slowly like a ribbon, and everything wakes up: church steeples look purple, hills seem to take off their hats, and birds start singing. It feels happy and full of energy, like being a little kid when everything is exciting.

But then the poem changes when it talks about sunset. The speaker says she doesn't really know how the sun sets, but she imagines it like kids climbing over a purple fence into the unknown. At the end, a shadowy like a priest or teacher quietly closes the gates of the day and leads everyone away, like how life eventually ends.

The poem shows how life is short but beautiful, just like a day. It starts bright and cheerful but ends softly and mysteriously. Dickinson doesn't make death scary just a natural part of the cycle. It makes you think about how we should enjoy the "morning" moments while we have them.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following</p>
        <p>a. How does the poet describe the morning sun in the first stanza?</p>
        <p>= In the first stanza, the poet describes the morning sun as rising slowly and beautifully. The sun's first golden rays spread like ribbons in the sky, lighting up the world. The sunlight makes everything bright and clear. It even changes the color of the church steeples to purple, which the poet calls "amethyst." The coming of the sun brings a sense of joy, warmth, and hope, marking the peaceful beginning of a new day.</p>
        <p>b. What does the line 'The news like squirrels ran' mean?</p>
        <p>= The line 'The news like squirrels ran' means that the news of the sun rising spread very quickly, just like squirrels that run fast. It shows how the light of the sun reaches everywhere in a short time. The poet uses a simile by comparing the spreading of the news to the fast movement of squirrels to show the quick change from night to day.</p>
        <p>c. What do you understand by the line 'The hills untied their bonnets'?</p>
        <p>= The line 'The hills untied their bonnets' means that the hills, which were covered in darkness before sunrise, began to glow and look beautiful when the sun rose. The poet imagines the hills like women wearing bonnets (hats), and as the sunlight touches them, it's as if they take off their bonnets to greet the morning. This line uses personification to make nature seem alive, showing how the sun changes the appearance of the hills.</p>
        <p>d. Is the speaker watching the morning sun? Why? Why not?</p>
        <p>= Yes, the speaker is watching the morning sun. She describes many beautiful things that happen as the sun rises, such as the steeple turning amethyst (purple), the hills untying their bonnets, and the birds called bobolinks singing. These clear and vivid descriptions show that the speaker is observing the sunrise with great attention and wonder.</p>
        <p>e. How does the sun set?</p>
        <p>= The poet describes the sunset as a mysterious and beautiful event. The sky turns purple and yellow as the sun goes down, and everything slowly becomes dark. However, the speaker says she doesn't really know what happens after the sun sets. This shows that the setting sun is a mystery to her, and she wonders where it goes, showing her curiosity and lack of full understanding about nature's cycle.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. What, according to the speaker, is a day?</p>
        <p>= According to the speaker, a day is a beautiful journey that begins with the rising sun, bringing light, color, and life to everything. The sun's rays wake up the hills, make the steeple glow, and cause the birds to sing. People become active and nature comes alive. As the day ends, the sun sets, the sky turns purple and dark, and everything becomes quiet again. Through the speaker's innocent eyes, a day represents the cycle of life from beginning to end, filled with wonder, beauty, and change.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. What purpose does the hyphen in the first line serve in the poem?</p>
        <p>= The hyphen in the first line of the poem serves as a pause, longer than a comma or semicolon, to slow down the reader and create a thoughtful, reflective tone. Emily Dickinson often uses hyphens in creative ways—not just for punctuation, but to let readers feel the rhythm, mood, or silence in a moment. In this poem, the hyphen allows space for imagination and emotion. It can also suggest something unspoken or give sudden emphasis to the words that follow. The pause helps emphasize the quiet beauty of the sunrise and draws attention to the wonder in the moment.</p>

        <p>c. What makes this poem lyrical and sonorous?</p>
        <p>= The poem "A Day" by Emily Dickinson is called lyrical because it shares the poet's personal feelings and thoughts. The poet uses the word “I,” which shows that she is telling us what she sees and feels in her own words. This makes the poem sound like a song or a diary.

The poem is also sonorous, which means it sounds nice when we read it aloud. This is because the poet uses rhyme and rhythm. She also repeats some sounds, which makes the poem smooth and musical. These things make the poem fun to listen to and easy to enjoy. It helps us feel the beauty of the sunrise, just like the poet does.</p>

        <p>d. Who are the target audience of the speaker? Why?</p>
        <p>= The speaker is mostly talking to children. The poem shows the world as if seen by a child, where everything looks beautiful and special. The speaker tells about the sunrise in a way that kids can understand and enjoy.

The poem also teaches about life — how a day is like a journey from morning to night, just like a person's life from the beginning to the end. So, even though the poem is for children, it can also help everyone understand more about life.</p>
      </div><div>
  <p>e. The poem looks like it talks about a day for children. How do adults feel about this poem?</p>
      <p>= When I talked to my parents, they said that the poem is about more than just a day. It talks about life itself — how life starts with hope and happiness like a sunrise, and then ends like the sunset when everything gets dark. Adults understand this better because they have lived many years and seen how life changes. So, while kids enjoy the poem for its pictures of morning and evening, adults see a deeper meaning about life and death.</p>

      <p>A Beautiful Morning

The sky is orange, bright and yellow,
Like a soft and shining pillow.
Birds are flying, singing loud,
Filling the air with songs so proud.

The fresh cool air smells sweet and clear,
A perfect start to a day so dear.
The world wakes up with light and cheer,
A beautiful morning, fresh and near.</p>

        <p>b. Write a personal essay on A Day in the School.</p>
        <p>A Day in the School (Last Day of SEE)

The last day of SEE at school is very special for all students. SEE is a big exam that we work hard for. On this day, I felt happy, excited, and a little sad too.

When I came to school, I saw my friends smiling and talking about the exam. Some were nervous, but most of us were happy because the exam time was over. Our teachers wished us good luck and told us to stay calm.

The school felt different that day. We didn't have normal classes. Instead, we talked, laughed, and remembered fun times we had together. We talked about how hard we studied and how this exam will help us in the future.

In the afternoon, there was a small program where teachers and students shared stories and wished each other well. Some friends even cried because it was the last time we would be together like this.

I felt proud and thankful for everything I learned and the friends I made. The last day of SEE was not just about finishing exams, but also about celebrating what we did and looking forward to what comes next.

That day taught me that endings can be happy beginnings too.</p>
