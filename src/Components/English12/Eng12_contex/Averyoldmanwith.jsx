        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The story begins with a strange event in a small, poor village by the sea. After days of rain, a couple named Pelayo and Elisenda find an old man lying face down in the mud in their backyard. The strange part? The man has huge wings. He is very dirty, weak, and speaks in a language no one understands.
</p><p>
Even though he looks human, the wings make people wonder if he is an angel. A neighbor says he must be one who has come to take their sick child to heaven. But when the child recovers, the villagers are even more confused about who or what this old man really is.
</p><p>
Pelayo and Elisenda decide to keep the old man in their chicken coop. People from all over the town and nearby villages come to see him, like a circus attraction. Instead of showing kindness or care, they treat him like a strange object, throwing food at him and poking him with sticks to see how he reacts.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, Father Gonzaga, the village priest, writes to the church authorities to find out if the man is truly an angel. But no clear answer ever comes. People eventually lose interest, especially after a new attraction arrives: a spider woman who was turned into a spider for disobeying her parents. Her story is easier to understand, so people are drawn to her instead.
</p><p>
The old man stays in the coop for a long time. Over time, he becomes part of the household, and Elisenda even charges people money to see him. They make enough money to build a big house and live comfortably.
</p><p>
Years pass. The old man becomes very sick, but he survives. Slowly, his strength returns, and one day, he spreads his wings and flies away, disappearing from their lives just as mysteriously as he came.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer thr following questions</p>
        <p className='question'>a. How Does The Narrator describe the weather and its effects in the exposition of the story?</p>
        <p>= At the beginning of the story "A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings," the narrator says that it had been raining for three days. Because of the heavy rain, the yard and house were full of water. Many crabs had come into the house, and they started to die, making the house smell very bad.
</p><p>
The sky and the sea looked the same, both turning grey. The beach, which used to shine at night, was now full of mud and dead sea animals. Everything looked wet, dirty, and gloomy because of the rain.</p>
        <p className='question'>b.Describe the strange old man as Palayo and his wife first encounter within their courtyard.</p>
        <p>= When Pelayo and his wife first saw the strange old man in their courtyard, he looked very weak and tired. He was lying face down in the muddy ground. He looked like a very old man with very little hair on his bald head and almost no teeth in his mouth. His clothes were dirty like a rag picker's, and he had huge, dirty wings that were covered in mud and feathers falling out. He looked strange and not like a normal person.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why did Pelayo and Elisenda imprison the old man in the chicken coop?</p>
        <p>= Pelayo and Elisenda put the old man in the chicken coop because they thought he might be an angel who came to take their sick baby. They were afraid of him but didn't want to hurt him. Their neighbors told them to kill the old man, but instead, they locked him in the chicken coop to keep him away from the baby and the house.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. Why was Father Gonzaga not sure about the old man being a celestial messenger?</p>
        <p>= Father Gonzaga didn't believe the old man was a real angel because the old man didn't know how to greet a priest and didn't speak the language of God (Latin). When Father said “good morning” in Latin, the old man didn't answer properly; he just mumbled in a strange language. Also, the old man looked dirty, had a bad smell, and his wings were full of bugs. So, Father Gonzaga thought he didn't seem like a real angel.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Many people gathered at Palayo's house to see the strange old man. Why do you think the crowd assembled to see him? </p>
        <p>= Many people came to Pelayo's house because they were curious about the old man with big wings. He looked very strange, and some people thought he might be an angel or a messenger from God. Others just wanted to see something unusual and have fun, like they would at a circus. So, a big crowd gathered to look at him.</p>
        <p className='question'>f. Some miracles happened while the crowd gathers to see the strange man.What are these miracles?
         </p>
        <p>= While many people came to see the old man with wings, some strange things happened. These are the miracles:
</p><p>
1. A blind man did not get his eyesight back, but he grew three new teeth.
</p><p>
2. A man who could not walk didn't get healed, but he almost won the lottery.
</p><p>
3. A man with sores on his skin (a leper) didn't get better, but flowers started growing from his sores.
</p><p>
Even though these were not the miracles people expected, they were still very unusual.</p>
        <p className='question'>g. State the irritating things that the people did with the strange old man.</p>
        <p>= The people did many mean and hurtful things to the old man with wings. They threw stones at him and pulled his feathers. Some even poked him with a hot iron and burned him just to see if he would move. They treated him like a circus animal and gave him food by tossing it through the wire. These things made the old man very sad and hurt.</p>
        <p className='question'>h. How and why was the woman changed into a spider?</p>
        <p>= The woman was changed into a spider because she didn't listen to her parents. She secretly went out to dance all night without asking for permission. When she was coming back through the forest, a loud thunder shook the sky. A lightning bolt came through the crack in the sky and hit her. That magic lightning turned her into a big spider with the head of a girl.</p>
        <p className='question'>i. Describe how Elisenda saw the strange man flying over the houses.</p>
        <p>= Elisenda was in the kitchen cutting onions for lunch. Suddenly, she felt a cool breeze coming from the sea. She went to the window to check, and to her surprise, she saw the strange old man flying in the sky! He was flapping his big wings like an old bird. He flew over the houses and slowly disappeared into the distance. Elisenda kept watching him until he was gone.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. The arrival of a strange old man at Palayo's courtyard arouses many suspicions and explanations. Explain how the neighbor woman, Father Gonzaga and the doctor speak of the strange man. Why do you think these three people give three different kinds of interpretations?</p>
        <p>= When the strange old man with wings appeared in Pelayo's courtyard, different people had different ideas about who he was.
</p><p>
1. The neighbour woman believed he was an angel sent to take their sick child to heaven. She thought he was very old and weak, which was why the rain had knocked him down.
</p><p>
2. Father Gonzaga, the priest, was doubtful that the old man was really an angel. He noticed that the man didn't understand Latin, the language of God, and didn't know how to greet church ministers properly. Also, his wings looked dirty and his body was too human. So, Father Gonzaga thought he might be an imposter or something else.
</p><p>
3. The doctor examined the man carefully and said it was impossible for such a creature to be alive. He heard strange sounds in the man's heart and kidneys and was amazed that he had wings like a bird.
</p><p>
These three people gave different explanations because they all saw the old man from their own experience and knowledge. The neighbour woman believed in angels and spirits. Father Gonzaga looked at things from a religious and spiritual point of view. The doctor used science and facts to understand him. That is why they had different opinions about the strange old man.</p>

        <p className='question'>b.This story belongs to the genre of 'magical realism', a genre perfected by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his novels and short stories. Magical realism is a narrative technique in which the story-teller narrates the common place things with magical color and the events look both magical and real at the same time. Collect five magic realist happenings from the story and argue why they seem magical to you.</p>
        <p>= The story “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” is a magical realism story. This means it mixes real-life events with magical or strange things that seem both real and magical at the same time. Here are five magical things that happen in the story and why they seem magical:
</p><p>
1. The old man has enormous wings.
This is magical because people don't have wings in real life. Seeing an old man with big bird wings feels like he belongs to another world.
</p><p>
2. The old man talks in a strange language.
When Pelayo and his wife try to talk to him, he answers in a language no one understands. This makes him seem mysterious and magical.
</p><p>
3. The neighbour woman says the old man is an angel.
Calling him an angel connects the story to something magical or spiritual, because angels are magical beings from stories and religions.
</p><p>
4. The woman who disobeyed her parents turns into a giant spider.
This is magical because people don't actually change into spiders. It's a strange, magical punishment that feels like a fairy tale.
</p><p>
5. The old man's feathers fall out but grow back again quickly, and he finally flies away.
This is magical because it's like he has special powers to heal himself and fly, which real people cannot do.
</p><p>
These things seem magical because they don't happen in our normal life. But the story tells them in a way that feels like they could be real, which is why it's called magical realism.</p>

        <p className='question'>c.The author introduces the episode of a woman who became a spider for having disobeyed her parents. This episode at once shifts people's concentration from the strange old man to the spider woman. What do you think is the purpose of the author to bring this shift in the story?</p>
        <p>= The author included the story of the woman who became a spider because she disobeyed her parents by going out to dance without permission. When lightning struck her, she changed into a giant spider. This magical and strange event is another example of magic in the story.
</p><p>
This story made people stop paying attention to the old man with wings and start watching the spider woman instead. The author did this to show how people often like exciting and interesting things more than mysterious or serious ones. The spider woman was part of a traveling show and was easier to understand, so many people forgot about the old man and went to see her.
</p><p>
The author wanted to show that people can be curious but also selfish and forgetful. They cared more about being entertained than about the old man who was kind but strange. This change in attention shows how human nature works — people like stories with clear lessons (like the spider woman's) and sometimes ignore things that are confusing or different (like the old man).</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>d. The story deals with the common people's gullibility. How do Palayo and his wife take advantage of common people's whim?</p>
        <p>= Pelayo and his wife found the old man with wings in their yard and didn't understand him. Their neighbor called him an “angel” who came to take their sick child. The child got better soon after, so people believed the old man was magical.
</p><p>
When many people came to see the old man, Pelayo's wife had an idea to charge visitors five cents to enter their yard and look at the “angel.” Lots of people paid because they were curious and believed the story.
</p><p>
Pelayo and his wife used this chance to make money from the visitors. They became rich and built a big, fancy house. This shows how they took advantage of people's curiosity and belief without caring much about the old man's suffering.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. An irresistible crowd queues at Palayo's house for many days simply to look at the strange old man. Narrate an episode from your experience or from another story where people assemble in crowds, not for any noble cause.</p>
        <p>= People waited in a long line at Pelayo's house to see a very old man with big wings. This reminds me of a story called “Night of the Scorpion.”
</p><p>
In that story, it was raining a lot, and a scorpion came inside the house and bit a lady. Lots of neighbors came running to help. They said prayers to make the scorpion stop moving. They looked for the scorpion with lanterns but couldn't find it.
</p><p>
The neighbors said the scorpion's poison would wash away the lady's bad luck and make her better. The lady's husband tried to help her by putting some medicine on her toe and even lighting a small fire there to stop the pain. After some time, the lady felt better and said thank you to God for protecting her kids.
</p><p>
People came together not because they wanted to help nicely, but because they were scared and curious—just like the crowd at Pelayo's house.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. The taste of children is different from grown-ups. What are the elements in the story that make 'The Old Man with Enormous Wings' a children's story?</p>
        <p>= “A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings” feels like a children's story because it has magical and strange characters, like the old man who looks like an angel with big wings. The story takes place in a simple village where people argue about who the old man really is, which makes it easy to understand. The people pay to see him, and this funny, lively scene is like a carnival, which children find exciting. The story uses simple language and talks about things we can see, smell, and feel, so kids can imagine it easily. There are magical parts too, like the woman who turns into a spider because she didn't obey her parents, which teaches a clear lesson for children. At the end, the old man flies away, which is a happy and magical ending that children love. All these things make the story like a modern fairy tale with magic, mystery, and a lesson, making it fun and interesting for children to read.</p>
