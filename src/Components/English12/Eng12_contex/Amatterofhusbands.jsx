        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>'A matter of husbands' act play tells the story of an ordinary wife who becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair with a beautiful and famous actress. The wife, who is very upset, goes to visit the actress in her theater dressing room after a performance. At first, the actress acts surprised and says she doesn't know what the wife is talking about. But then, in a very dramatic way, the actress suddenly changes her story! She pretends that she really has been seeing the husband, making up details about secret meetings and love letters. She acts so convincing that the poor wife completely believes her and becomes heartbroken.
</p><p>
Just when the wife is at her saddest moment, the actress reveals the truth - it was all an act! She was just pretending to teach the wife a lesson about jumping to conclusions. The actress explains that she never actually met the husband at all. In the end, we learn the real reason why the husband had been acting strangely - he was secretly saving money to buy his wife a special birthday present, not cheating on her!
</p><p>
The play shows us several important lessons in a fun, dramatic way. First, it teaches us not to assume the worst without proof. The wife's jealousy and suspicions almost ruined her marriage when there was no real problem. Second, it shows how good communication could have prevented the whole misunderstanding. If the wife had just talked calmly to her husband first, she would have learned the truth. Finally, the play demonstrates how easily people can be fooled by good acting and dramatic stories, which is funny since it's happening in a theater!
</p><p>
The characters are interesting too. The wife represents how normal people can sometimes let their emotions control them. The actress is clever and theatrical, using her acting skills to make a point. And the unseen husband turns out to be more thoughtful than anyone realized. The whole play happens in one room, making it feel very intense and personal, like we're right there watching the confrontation.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Sketch the character of Famous Actress.</p>
        <p>= The Famous Actress is a young, beautiful, and celebrated woman admired and envied by many. She appears innocent and harmless on the surface, but underneath she is cunning, manipulative, and deceitful. She skillfully fabricates a convincing story to make the Earnest Young Woman believe that her husband's affair is just a game to regain her love. This shows her cleverness and ability to manipulate others. Moreover, her immoral nature is revealed at the end when it becomes clear that she is having a secret relationship with the Earnest Young Woman's husband, Alfred, thus destroying their marriage. Overall, she is portrayed as a wicked and self-centered character who prioritizes her desires over others' feelings.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Shed light on the difference between an ordinary woman and an actress.</p>
        <p>= In the play, the ordinary woman is simple-minded, trusting, and emotional. She is deeply hurt and worried about her husband's supposed affair and easily believes the story told by the actress without questioning it. She is timid and vulnerable, showing her innocence and lack of experience in handling such complex situations.
</p><p>
On the other hand, the famous actress is clever, cunning, and manipulative. She skillfully deceives the ordinary woman by fabricating a convincing story to hide the truth about her relationship with the husband. The actress is confident and experienced in playing roles, not only on stage but also in real life, using her wit to control the situation and protect her interests.
</p><p>
Thus, the main difference lies in the actress's shrewdness and ability to manipulate, while the ordinary woman is naive and easily misled.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. According to Famous Actress, men associated with theatre use the theatre actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so as to woo them back. Do you agree with her argument? Why? Why not?</p>
        <p>= According to the Famous Actress, men involved in theatre sometimes use actresses to make their estranged wives jealous so they can win them back. While this might be true in some cases, I do not fully agree with this argument. In reality, many men involved with theatre do develop genuine romantic relationships with actresses or models, often leading to actual affairs rather than mere acts to provoke jealousy.

In the play, although the actress claims it's all a clever ruse, the ending reveals that Alfred and the actress are genuinely involved, which shows the relationship is not just a ploy. This suggests that men and actresses sometimes have selfish motives and engage in real affairs, which can ruin their marriages.

Furthermore, in today's world, some actresses might enter relationships with married men for personal gain, such as money or career opportunities, which complicates the situation further. Therefore, while the Famous Actress's argument might hold in some situations, it doesn't apply universally, and many cases reflect genuine infidelity rather than a strategy to win back wives.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. How does Famous Actress make a fool of Earnest Young Woman?</p>
        <p>= The Famous Actress fools the Earnest Young Woman by telling her that the supposed affair is just a misunderstanding. She explains that men associated with theatre often use actresses to make their estranged wives jealous in order to regain their love. She convinces the Earnest Young Woman that her husband is only pretending to be involved with her to make the Earnest Young Woman jealous and bring back her affection. Believing this story, the Earnest Young Woman feels guilty for doubting her husband and apologizes, unaware that she has been tricked.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. The conversation between the two women takes place on the stage of the theatre. What role does the theatre house as a part of setting play in A Matter for Husband?</p>
        <p>= The theatre house, especially the detailed setting of the famous actress's luxurious drawing room and boudoir, plays a crucial role in A Matter of Husbands. It creates a realistic and intimate atmosphere where the confrontation between the Earnest Young Woman and the Famous Actress unfolds. The exotic and elegant setting reflects the glamorous yet deceptive world of the actress, contrasting with the innocence of the Earnest Young Woman. This setting helps the audience understand the social difference between the two women and emphasizes the theme of illusion versus reality, as the actress uses her staged environment and acting skills to manipulate the young woman. Thus, the theatre house is not just a physical backdrop but an important element that highlights the play's message about deception, appearances, and the harsh truths behind social facades.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>f. What do you think about the ending of the play?</p>
        <p>= The ending of the play A Matter of Husbands is striking and full of irony. On the surface, it seems perfect because the conflict between the characters is “resolved”: the Famous Actress convinces the Earnest Young Woman that her husband's affair was just a ruse to make her jealous and regain her love. The Earnest Young Woman leaves happily convinced, and the actress and the husband continue their relationship without obstacles.
</p><p>
However, the irony lies in the truth behind the actress's words. Although she tells the young woman that her husband truly loves her, the reality is that he does not—he is actually cheating on his wife. This ending highlights the theme that innocent and sincere people often suffer at the hands of cunning and deceitful ones. The young woman's innocence makes her vulnerable, while the actress's cleverness allows her to manipulate the situation.
</p><p>
So, while the play ends with apparent harmony, it leaves the audience with a bitter reflection on human nature and relationships. The phrase “All is well that ends well” seems ironic here, as the “well” is based on deception and false hopes.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>

From a young age, Emma showed great talent and dedication to her craft, bringing to life one of the most beloved characters in literature and film. But Emma is much more than just an actress.

        <p className='question'>b. John Cassavetes says, "I'm very worried about the depiction of women on the screen. It's gotten worse than ever and it's related to their being either high or low-class concubines .... There's nothing to do with the dreams of women, or of woman as the dream, nothing to do with the quirky part of her, the wonder of her." How do you assess Famous Actress in the light of Cassavetes' argument about the portrayal of women?</p>
        <p>= John Cassavetes, a famous American actor, expressed his concern about how women are often shown on screen. He feels that their portrayal has gotten worse over time. According to him, many female characters are shown as either being high-class or low-class mistresses, focused mainly on money or relationships, rather than showing their true dreams, emotions, and unique qualities. This makes the representation of women shallow and unrealistic.
</p><p>
In the play A Matter of Husbands, the character of the Famous Actress fits into Cassavetes' criticism. She is involved with the lawyer, even though he is married, and she seems to care more about the affair than understanding the pain of the lawyer's wife. She acts cleverly to deceive the Earnest Young Woman and shows little sympathy for her feelings. This makes her a good example of the kind of one-dimensional, selfish female character that Cassavetes worries about. So, I think Cassavetes' words apply well to the Famous Actress, showing how women can be unfairly and negatively portrayed both in plays and on screen.</p>
