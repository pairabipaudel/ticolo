        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p>= In the poem "Soft Storm" by Abhi Subedi, the speaker reflects a deep sense of compassion and sensitivity amidst the chaos and turmoil of modern society. The phrase "grow soft" represents moments when the speaker becomes emotionally touched or overwhelmed by human suffering and natural beauty.

The occasions when the speaker grows soft include:

1. When he hears the tumult of the earth, indicating the emotional disturbance caused by societal disorder.

2. When the sky grows like crocuses, symbolizing a moment of natural beauty and transformation.

3. When the moon skids down, portraying an image of vulnerability and emotional turbulence.

4. When the moon sings of lampposts and gutters, reflecting on the neglected parts of the city and the unseen suffering.

5. When he sees homeless children crying with hunger in Thamel, showing empathy for the marginalized.

6. When he returns from the melee, possibly alluding to political chaos or violent crowds, realizing the madness of the times.

These moments reflect the speaker's inner sensitivity and his humanitarian outlook, even in a world filled with noise, conflict, and neglect.

</p>
<p>b. What do you understand by 'this seamless city'?</p>
<p>= The phrase “this seamless city” refers to a city without visible divisions, boundaries, or interruptions. It suggests an urban environment where everything flows smoothly, both physically and socially. However, in the context of the poem Soft Storm, this phrase may carry a sense of irony.

Although the city appears seamless on the surface, it hides deep social issues such as poverty, inequality, and human suffering. The poet might be pointing to a city where:

1. Differences and injustices are overlooked.

2. People appear connected outwardly but are emotionally or morally distant.

3. There is a lack of visible resistance, making problems like homelessness and injustice go unnoticed.

Thus, “this seamless city” can be understood as a symbol of modern urban life—physically connected, yet socially fragmented.</p>
<p>c. Describe the poor children portrayed in the poem.</p>
<p>= In the poem Soft Storm by Abhi Subedi, the poor children are portrayed as homeless, hungry, and helpless. They are seen crying with hunger under the bat-bearing trees of Keshar Mahal in Thamel, a busy urban area. These children represent the harsh reality of poverty and neglect in society.

They are deprived of love, care, shelter, and even the basic needs of life. The poet highlights their suffering and innocence, making them a symbol of social injustice and the failure of the system to protect the most vulnerable. Their presence in the poem evokes sympathy and reflects the emotional 'softness' or compassion the speaker feels amidst the chaos of modern life.</p>
<p>d. What do you understand by 'the unwedded gardens of history'?</p>
<p>= The phrase 'the unwedded gardens of history' refers to the neglected, untouched, or unrecognized parts of history and culture, particularly of the Kathmandu Valley. It symbolizes the glorious heritage, traditions, and historical richness that have been ignored, left uncared for, or disconnected from the present.

The term "unwedded" suggests a lack of union or connection, implying that modern society has failed to value or preserve its past properly. These gardens, once full of beauty and meaning, now stand as forgotten symbols of a culturally rich but poorly maintained legacy.</p>
<p>e. Why was the forlorn child wailing?</p>
<p>= The forlorn child was wailing because he was searching for his mother in the corridors of violent history. This symbolizes the loss, displacement, and suffering caused by conflict, social unrest, or political violence. The child's cry represents the pain of innocent people, especially children, who become victims of historical turmoil and are left abandoned, unheard, and uncared for.</p>
<p>f. What do you understand about 'soft storm'?</p>
<p>= The term 'soft storm' symbolizes the poet's inner emotional turbulence and sensitivity in response to the chaos and problems in contemporary society. While a storm usually suggests destruction and violence, the word soft indicates that these feelings are not aggressive but rather gentle, reflective, and compassionate. It reflects the poet's quiet pain, concern, and subtle resistance to the injustices, poverty, and emotional struggles surrounding him. The "soft storm" blends external societal issues with the speaker's internal emotional reaction, showing a contrast between turmoil and tenderness.</p>
<p>g. Why does the speaker call our time 'mad time'?</p>
<p>= The speaker calls our time a 'mad time' because he observes a world full of contradictions, chaos, and irrational behaviors. People have become selfish, mannerless, and driven by materialism. Laws and moral values seem ignored, and society appears to function without proper order or justice. Corruption, favoritism, and injustice dominate political and social systems.

He notices unnatural and surreal events, such as stones growing on flowers, rhododendrons blooming in winter, birds singing tumult instead of melody, and history hiding under lampposts. These bizarre and symbolic images represent a world that has lost its balance, making the present time feel disturbed and insane. This combination of social, political, and environmental instability leads the speaker to describe it as a “mad time.”</p>
<p>h. What does the speaker want to do in “hard times”?</p>
<p>= In “hard times,” the speaker expresses a desire to melt like a rainbow, which symbolizes his soft-hearted nature and emotional sensitivity. By saying this, he reveals his wish to disappear peacefully and beautifully in the face of pain and suffering, rather than reacting with anger or violence.

It shows his gentle response to the chaos and cruelty of the world around him. Instead of becoming hardened or bitter, he chooses to remain compassionate, even if that means fading away like something fragile and beautiful during difficult times.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. The poet uses the word 'soft' with the words like 'storm' and 'gale', which generally refer to disorder and violence. What effect does the poet achieve through the use of such anomalous expressions?</p>
        <p>= In the poem "Soft Storm" by Abhi Subedi, the poet uses anomalous expressions like “soft storm” and “softness rose like a gale” to convey deep emotional and psychological conflicts in a poetic and symbolic way. These expressions are paradoxical, as “storm” and “gale” usually represent violence, chaos, or destruction, while “soft” suggests gentleness, calmness, and compassion.

By combining such contradictory terms, the poet creates a powerful poetic effect that reflects his inner emotional turmoil, as well as the silent suffering and disturbance he observes in society. The use of these anomalies allows the poet to express intense emotions in a subtle and thought-provoking manner, blending external chaos with internal sensitivity.

These expressions also symbolize the emotional tension between hope and despair, gentleness and aggression, and order and disorder in contemporary life. The contrast helps the readers visualize the complex psychological and social landscape the poet is navigating.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>b. What is the speaker's attitude towards the time he describes in the poem?</p>
        <p>= The speaker's attitude toward the time described in the poem "Soft Storm" is largely negative, critical, and disturbed. He refers to it as a “mad time”, indicating that he sees the present era as chaotic, unjust, and out of control. The speaker observes unusual, irrational, and lawless behavior in society. He sees people acting without manners, systems failing, and values deteriorating.

This creates a sense of inner disturbance and frustration in him. Although there may be moments of nostalgia or hope, they are overshadowed by his disappointment in how modern society has lost harmony, humanity, and moral direction. His tone reflects disillusionment and a longing for peace and sanity in an otherwise disorderly world.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>c. What is the speaker like? Is he a rebel? Why? Why not?</p>
        <p>= Yes, the speaker in "Soft Storm" can be considered a rebel, though not in a loud or violent sense. He is a sensitive and observant individual who is deeply disturbed by the disorder, corruption, and loss of humanity in modern society. He sees people suffering, the poor being ignored, and the richness of history being forgotten.

While he does not openly revolt or take radical action, he questions the chaos and challenges the unjust norms through his thoughts and poetic expressions. His rebellion is internal, emotional, and intellectual. He criticizes the inhumanity and materialism around him and expresses a longing for compassion, order, and justice. Therefore, the speaker is a soft rebel, using his words as a form of resistance against the madness of his time.</p>

      <div>
        <p>d. Explain the stanza below in your own words:
I became soft
when I saw
a blood-stained shirt
speaking in the earth's ears
with bruised human lips
in the far corner
under the moon
of history and dreams
playing hide and seek
in open museums
of human times.</p>
        <p>= In this stanza from “Soft Storm” by Abhi Subedi, the speaker describes a powerful emotional reaction—he becomes "soft," meaning emotionally disturbed and compassionate—upon witnessing a deeply troubling scene.

He sees a blood-stained shirt, which symbolizes a victim of violence or suffering, lying on the ground. The "shirt speaking in the earth's ears with bruised human lips" is a poetic way of saying that the suffering person is either dead or gravely injured, and the earth itself is being asked to hear this silent cry.

This person lies “under the moon of history and dreams,” suggesting that this suffering is part of a long history of forgotten struggles and unfulfilled hopes. The moon symbolizes past glories or dreams, now dimmed or ignored.

The phrase “playing hide and seek in open museums of human times” implies that history—especially the truth about suffering, injustice, and violence—is often hidden or selectively remembered. Museums, which are supposed to preserve truth, may instead present only certain versions of events.

In essence, the speaker feels a surge of sorrow and quiet rebellion upon seeing how human suffering is ignored, how violence is part of a long and often hidden history, and how society has become numb to compassion.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. Write an essay, highlighting your dissatisfaction towards social, cultural, economic and political issues prevailing in Nepal at present.</p>
        <p>My Dissatisfaction with the Current Social, Cultural, Economic, and Political Issues in Nepal
Nepal, a country rich in natural beauty and cultural heritage, is known around the world for its majestic mountains, diverse ethnic groups, and centuries-old traditions. However, despite its potential, I feel deeply dissatisfied with the current state of our country. Various social, cultural, economic, and political issues are severely hampering the development and peace of Nepal. These challenges continue to frustrate not only me but countless others who dream of a better Nepal.

Social Issues
Nepal's society today is riddled with serious problems such as poverty, hunger, unemployment, gender inequality, caste discrimination, illiteracy, rape, and human trafficking. These issues have become so deeply rooted that they are now seen as part of everyday life. It is heartbreaking to see young girls trafficked across the border, women denied basic rights, and poor people struggling daily for food and dignity. The indifference of society and authorities towards these problems creates even more frustration and helplessness.

Cultural Issues
Nepal is home to more than 100 ethnic groups and multiple religious traditions. But instead of uniting us, our diversity has sometimes become a source of division. People are more focused on promoting their own ethnic or regional identities than building a strong, united national identity. There is growing cultural intolerance, and cultural clashes often take political forms. The essence of our cultural harmony is being lost in unnecessary debates, and this has weakened national unity.

Economic Issues
Nepal remains one of the poorest countries in South Asia, despite having vast potential in tourism, hydropower, agriculture, and youth energy. The reasons behind our economic backwardness are clear: political instability, lack of good governance, corruption, and poor infrastructure. Youths are compelled to go abroad for low-paying labor jobs because our own economy has failed to provide opportunities. This economic dependency is a major setback for our national progress, and I feel angry and disappointed at the negligence of those in power.

Political Issues
Among all, political instability is the biggest reason behind our national crisis. In the past few decades, Nepal has witnessed frequent changes in government, weak leadership, and the misuse of democracy. Corruption is widespread, and politicians are more focused on gaining power than solving real issues. Elections are influenced by money and manipulation, and promises made to citizens are rarely kept. I feel that politics in Nepal has become a dirty game rather than a means to serve the people. This has made the public lose trust in political leaders and democratic systems.

Conclusion
To sum up, the current state of Nepal is deeply disappointing, despite its rich resources and incredible cultural wealth. Social injustices, cultural fragmentation, economic failure, and political corruption are all pushing the country backwards. As a responsible citizen, I believe it is important to raise our voices against these issues and strive for reform. Nepal deserves better leadership, stronger systems, and a society that values unity, progress, and justice. Only then can we build a nation we are truly proud of.

        <p></p>
        <p>=Respected teachers, friends, and fellow citizens,

Today, I stand here not as a follower, but as a rebel—someone who dares to dream of a better Nepal.

Our country is full of beauty and potential, but it's drowning in corruption, discrimination, poverty, and injustice. Girls are denied education. The poor are ignored. Leaders make promises but forget the people. And we? We stay silent.

But I say—enough is enough.

My Vision for Change
1. I want a society where caste and gender don't limit dreams.
2. Where education and jobs come from talent, not bribes.
3. Where people care for one another—not just during festivals, but every day.</p>
<p>What I Will Do
1. I will raise my voice against injustice.
2. I will respect every human, no matter their background.
3. I will encourage unity, knowledge, and action.

Final Words
Real change doesn't start in big speeches—it starts with small actions. I may be one voice, but I believe that one voice can spark a revolution.
Thank you</p>
