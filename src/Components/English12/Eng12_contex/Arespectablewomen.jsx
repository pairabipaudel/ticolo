        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. Why was Mrs. Baroda unhappy with the information about Gouvernail's visit to their farm?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Baroda was unhappy with the information about Gouvernail's visit to their farm because she had been looking forward to a period of unbroken rest and undisturbed conversation with her husband, Gaston. She had also never met Gouvernail before and was unsure about hosting a guest she did not know, especially during a time she had hoped to spend peacefully with her husband.</p>
        <p>b. How was Gouvernail different from Mrs. Baroda's expectation?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Baroda had imagined Gouvernail to be a tall, slim, and cynical man, wearing eyeglasses and keeping his hands in his pockets. However, when she met him, he turned out to be quite different. Although he was slim, he was not very tall, nor was he cynical. He did not wear glasses or keep his hands in his pockets. Instead, he was quiet, courteous, and thoughtful—qualities that gradually made Mrs. Baroda feel unexpectedly drawn to him.</p>
        <p>c. How does Mrs. Baroda compare Gouvernail with her husband?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Baroda compares Gouvernail with her husband mainly in terms of their personalities. Her husband, Gaston Baroda, is frank, sociable, and talkative, whereas Gouvernail is quiet, reserved, and thoughtful. She does not find the brilliant and promising qualities in Gouvernail that her husband had often praised. Although Gouvernail is polite and gentle, Mrs. Baroda considers him unsociable in comparison to her outgoing husband.</p>
        <p>d. Why and how did Mrs. Baroda try to change Gouvernail's solitary habits?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Baroda was a frank and lively woman who wanted Gouvernail to be more open, talkative, and engaging, so that he would feel at home in their company. She tried to change his solitary habits by being friendly, straightforward, and offering warm, wordy hospitality, encouraging him to open up and participate more actively in conversations.</p>
        <p>e. How does Gaston disagree with his wife on Gouvernail's character?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Baroda was taking Gouvernail seriously and saw him as a less interesting and shy person. However, Gaston disagreed with his wife's view, saying that Gouvernail caused no trouble and disliked commotion. Gaston described Gouvernail as a remarkable, friendly, interesting, and talkative person, which contrasted with Mrs. Baroda's impression of him.</p>
        <p>f. Why is Gaston surprised with his wife's expression towards the end of the story?</p>
        <p>= Gaston is surprised with his wife's expression towards the end of the story because although she did not like Gouvernail's arrival at first, she later, entirely on her own, proposed that Gouvernail should visit them again. This change in her attitude was unexpected by Gaston.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. What is the cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda's mind? What role does Mrs. Baroda 'being a respectable woman' play in the story?</p>
        <p>= The main cause of conflict in Mrs. Baroda's mind is her unexpected attraction towards Gouvernail, her husband's friend, along with her fear of societal judgment. Although she feels deeply drawn to Gouvernail, so much that she even imagines touching his face and lips, she restrains herself because she is a respectable woman who follows social norms.

Being a respectable woman plays a crucial role in the story as it represents Mrs. Baroda's inner struggle between personal desires and social expectations. Despite her feelings, she controls her emotions and lets the societal values and her own sense of dignity guide her actions. In the end, Mrs. Baroda proves her strength and respectability by managing her feelings maturely and welcoming Gouvernail's visits without crossing social boundaries.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
        <p>b. Sketch the character of Gouvernail and contrast it with Gaston.</p>
        <p>= Gouvernail is Mr. Baroda’s college friend who comes to spend a week or two at the Baroda couple’s sugar plantation. He is described as a slim and attractive man, who does not wear eyeglasses. Gouvernail is gentle, lovable, and inoffensive by nature. He is quiet, peace-loving, and prefers solitude. He is neither very frank nor too talkative. He enjoys sitting silently on the portico, smoking a cigar, and taking in the fresh air. He is content with whatever is offered by his hosts and does not make any demands.

In contrast, Gaston (Mr. Baroda) is a cheerful, frank, and sociable man. He talks freely, is more outgoing, and loves company. While Gouvernail is introverted and reserved, Gaston is extroverted and expressive. Gaston is also portrayed as a polite and hospitable husband, who cares deeply for his wife. He does not smoke, unlike Gouvernail.

Gouvernail's reserved and calm demeanor creates an inner conflict in Mrs. Baroda, as he is quite different from the lively and talkative nature she is accustomed to in her husband. While Gaston symbolizes familiarity and marital stability, Gouvernail represents temptation and emotional disturbance for Mrs. Baroda. This contrast plays a key role in the central theme of the story.</p>

       <div>
        <p>c. Why does Mrs. Baroda not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Baroda does not disclose her feelings towards Gouvernail to her husband because she considers herself a respectable woman and fears the consequences of revealing such emotions. She is deeply aware of societal expectations and understands that expressing attraction to another man, especially her husband's friend, would be seen as immoral and inappropriate.

She knows that her husband, like most men, would not accept his wife being emotionally drawn to someone else. Revealing her feelings might damage their marital bond and also harm the close friendship between Gaston and Gouvernail.

Although she feels tempted and emotionally conflicted, she chooses to fight the battle within herself rather than involve her husband. As the story says, "there are some battles in life which a human being must fight alone." She sensibly decides to leave for the city to avoid further emotional disturbance and only returns after Gouvernail has left.

By the end of the story, she regains control over her feelings and surprises her husband by expressing a desire to meet Gouvernail again—this time as a composed and self-disciplined woman. This shows her inner strength and determination to uphold her dignity and values.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
        <p>d. The last three sentences of the story bring a kind of twist. After reading these three sentences, how do you analyze Mrs. Baroda's attitude towards Gouvernail?</p>
        <p>= The last three sentences of “A Respectable Woman” bring an unexpected twist and raise questions about Mrs. Baroda's true intentions. Throughout the story, she struggles with her growing attraction toward Gouvernail but restrains herself due to her self-image as a respectable woman and the fear of social judgment. She even leaves the house temporarily to distance herself and regain control over her emotions.

However, the twist occurs when she later suggests inviting Gouvernail again and confidently tells her husband, “I have overcome everything! You will see. This time I shall be very nice to him.” This statement is ambiguous and open to multiple interpretations.

On one hand, it may imply that Mrs. Baroda has conquered her emotional conflict and is now ready to treat Gouvernail with genuine friendliness, without romantic attachment. This would mean she has matured, accepted his presence, and is no longer troubled by her past feelings.

On the other hand, the phrase “I shall be very nice to him” could suggest that she is no longer trying to suppress her desires. It may hint that she has stopped resisting her emotions and is prepared to act according to her heart rather than societal norms.

Ultimately, this twist leaves the reader uncertain about her true mindset. It challenges the idea of what it means to be a “respectable woman” and whether Mrs. Baroda's inner transformation is one of self-control or quiet rebellion.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. The entry of an outsider into a family has been a recurring subject in both literature and films. Narrate a story real or imaginative where an outsider's arrival destroys the intimate relationship between the husband and the wife and causes break up in marital relationship without direct fault of anyone. Anton's Chekhov's story 'About Love' is a story on this subject.</p>
        <p>= Anton Chekhov's short story “About Love” is a powerful example of how the arrival of an outsider can unintentionally disrupt a married couple's relationship. The story revolves around Alyohin, a thoughtful and educated man who becomes involved in the life of Dmitry Luganovich, a judge, and his much younger wife Anna Luganovich.

Anna is a beautiful, intelligent, and kind woman, living peacefully with her husband despite a significant age difference. When Alyohin begins visiting their home, he and Anna develop a close bond. They spend time together, exchange gifts, attend theatre shows, and share their personal joys and sorrows. Slowly, their emotional connection deepens into unspoken love.

Despite their feelings, neither of them crosses moral boundaries. Alyohin keeps his emotions hidden out of respect for social norms and for Anna's marriage. However, the emotional tension and suppression cause mental stress and emotional exhaustion for Anna. She eventually suffers from a neurotic condition, and the peaceful marital relationship she once had begins to break apart—not because of anyone's fault, but because of circumstances and emotional confusion.

In the end, Anna leaves for Crimea for medical treatment and emotional relief. Before departing, she and Alyohin share a final moment of emotional truth—they embrace and cry, and Alyohin finally confesses his love. But it's too late. Their love remains incomplete, and Anna leaves, never to return.

This story mirrors Kate Chopin's “A Respectable Woman,” where Mrs. Baroda also faces emotional conflict due to the arrival of her husband's friend Gouvernail. In both stories, the outsider doesn't intend to cause harm, yet his presence triggers emotional turmoil and distance in the marriage. These narratives highlight how powerful and disruptive unspoken emotions can be, even without anyone doing anything explicitly wrong.</p>
       </div>
       <div>
        <p>b. Mrs. Baroda makes an expectation about Gouvernail even before meeting him. Suppose you are a mature girl/boy and your family members are giving you pressure for getting married. Write in about 200 words describing what qualities you would like to get in your future husband/wife.</p>
        <p>= Marriage is a lifelong bond that should be based on love, trust, and understanding. It’s not just about two individuals living together but about building a life, a family, and a future. Since this decision greatly influences one's entire life, it should not be made in haste or under pressure.

If my family urges me to marry, I would like my future life partner to have the following qualities:

He should be loving and caring, not just to me but also to my family members. Respect for elders, kindness, and politeness in behavior are very important. I would want him to be understanding and supportive, especially during difficult times. He should be a good listener who values my thoughts and opinions.

I hope he is financially independent, emotionally mature, and able to balance work and family life. A good sense of humor, a positive attitude, and the ability to enjoy small moments in life are traits I admire.

More than physical appearance, inner beauty, honesty, and loyalty matter most. Marriage is not about perfection, but about growing together—and I want someone who is ready to grow with me.</p>
