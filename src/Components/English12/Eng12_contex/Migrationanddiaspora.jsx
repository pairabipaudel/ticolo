        <p className='question'>B. Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. According to the author, what are the three aspects of migration?</p>
        <p>= According to the author, migration involves three important aspects: the forward motion, which is the movement of people from one place to another; the migrants themselves, meaning the individuals or groups who move; and the backward motion, which refers to the effects and changes in the places people leave behind as well as how migrants maintain connections with their original homes.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Which aspect of migration is neglected by the researchers?</p>
        <p>= Researchers often neglect the multidimensional nature of the diasporization aspect of migration. This means they do not fully study how migrants maintain connections with their homeland and how these connections affect both the migrants and their original communities.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What is 'dediasporization'?</p>
        <p>= Dediasporization is the process through which a person who belongs to a diaspora reconnects with their homeland in different ways. This can happen by returning to their home country and regaining citizenship, by fully adapting and blending into the society of the country they live in, or by actively participating in the cultural and social connections between their home country and the country they now live in.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Why is the role of the state important in dediasporization?</p>
        <p>= The role of the state is important in dediasporization because the state oversees and controls the process to ensure that individuals seeking to reconnect with their homeland meet the requirements to regain citizenship. The state confirms their eligibility and grants them the rights and responsibilities that come with being a citizen. This involvement helps regulate who can rejoin the national community and under what conditions.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. How is Chinese diaspora in the Caribbean different from others?</p>
        <p>= The Chinese diaspora in the Caribbean is different from other diasporas because, despite having lived there for more than a century, they are still considered foreigners by the local Caribbean people. Unlike some other migrant groups who may have been fully accepted over time, the Chinese community continues to face social and cultural exclusion, making their experience unique compared to other diasporas.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. Why is it difficult to regain citizenship after returning to the homeland?</p>
        <p>= It is difficult to regain citizenship after returning to the homeland because being accepted as a citizen involves more than just physically coming back. The state must legally recognize the person's right to citizenship, which involves meeting certain requirements and going through official procedures. Without this legal approval, a returnee cannot fully integrate into society or enjoy the rights and privileges of citizenship.</p>

        <p className='question'>g. What do the Germans feel towards the returnees from Russia, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan?</p>
        <p>= The Germans tend to feel distant and somewhat alienated towards the people returning from Russia, Kazakhstan, and Uzbekistan. Even though these returnees may have German ancestry, they are often seen as outsiders because of their different experiences and cultural backgrounds. This sense of alienation makes it difficult for returnees to fully feel accepted in German society.</p>

        <p className='question'>h. How are the returnees' activities in Israel different from that of other countries?</p>
        <p>= The returnees' activities in Israel differ from those in other countries because they fully assert their citizenship rights. They actively participate in the political process by forming their own political parties, advocating for freedom, and promoting the rights of other citizens. This level of political involvement and empowerment is often greater than that of returnees in many other countries.</p>

        <p className='question'>i. What is the role of the individual in dediasporization?</p>
        <p>= The role of the individual in dediasporization is to adapt and integrate into the culture and society of their homeland while maintaining their citizenship. They are expected to actively participate in the social, cultural, and economic life of the nation and contribute to its growth and development. By doing so, individuals help strengthen national identity and support the process of nation-building.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Many Nepali people are living in foreign countries now and they knows as Non-Residential Nepali (NRNs). The NRNs are asking for dual citizenship rights. Do you think the Government of Nepal should address their demands?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I believe the Government of Nepal should seriously consider the demands of Non-Residential Nepalis (NRNs) for dual citizenship rights. NRNs contribute significantly to the country's economy through remittances, investments, and by promoting Nepal's culture abroad. Granting them dual citizenship would recognize their valuable role and strengthen their connection to Nepal.</p>
        <p>Dual citizenship would allow NRNs to enjoy rights such as owning property, voting, and participating in social and economic development without having to give up their citizenship of the country where they live. This would encourage more NRNs to invest in Nepal and actively contribute to the nation's progress.</p>
        <p>However, the government should also put clear rules in place to ensure that dual citizenship is managed fairly and benefits both the country and its citizens. Addressing NRNs' demands would be a positive step toward strengthening Nepal's ties with its diaspora and promoting inclusive development.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. The NRNs celebrate festivals like Teej, Dashain, Loshar, Id and Holi in foreign countries. What do these celebrations signify?</p>
        <p>= The celebration of festivals such as Teej, Dashain, Loshar, Id, and Holi by Non-Residential Nepalis (NRNs) living abroad holds deep significance. These festivals are much more than just cultural or religious rituals; they represent a vital connection to their roots and homeland. For many NRNs, living in foreign countries can sometimes feel isolating and challenging because they are far away from their families, traditions, and familiar surroundings. Celebrating these festivals allows them to keep a part of Nepal alive within their new homes.</p>
        <p>These celebrations are a way for NRNs to preserve their identity and culture. By observing traditional festivals, they pass on their rich heritage, values, and customs to their children who may have been born or raised in foreign countries. It helps the younger generation understand and appreciate where they come from, creating a bridge between their Nepali heritage and the culture of their new country.</p>
        <p>Moreover, these festivals bring the Nepali community together, helping them build a sense of unity and support in places far from home. Celebrations like Dashain and Holi become occasions to meet, share food, dance, and remember the stories and customs that define their culture. It strengthens social bonds and gives NRNs a sense of belonging even when they are thousands of miles away.</p>
        <p>In addition, celebrating these festivals in foreign lands promotes cultural exchange. When NRNs invite their friends and neighbors to join in the festivities, they share Nepal's diversity and traditions with the wider world. This fosters understanding, respect, and appreciation for Nepalese culture internationally.</p>
