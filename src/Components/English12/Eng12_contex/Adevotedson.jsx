        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>"A Devoted Son" by Anita Desai tells the emotional story of Rakesh, a man who appears to be the ideal son. He works hard to become a successful doctor, respects his parents' wishes by having an arranged marriage, and chooses to live with them to take care of them in their old age. At first, his father Varma couldn't be prouder, constantly telling everyone about his wonderful, devoted son. However, when Varma becomes elderly and sick, Rakesh transforms from a loving son into a strict doctor. He forbids his father from eating any of his favorite foods, insisting it's for his health, even when the old man begs for just a little sweetness in his life. While Rakesh believes he's doing what's best, his father feels imprisoned by these rules and grows increasingly unhappy. The heartbreaking story makes us wonder - is Rakesh truly devoted, or has his medical professionalism and strictness actually made his father's final years miserable? It shows how even with good intentions, we can sometimes hurt those we love most when we don't listen to what they really want and need.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. How did the morning papers bring an ambience of celebration to the Varma family?</p>
        <p>= The morning papers brought an ambience of celebration to the Varma family by announcing that Rakesh had secured the top position in the national medical entrance examination. It was a moment of great pride for the family, as Rakesh became not only the highest-ranking student in the country but also the first member of their family to achieve such a prestigious academic milestone. His success symbolized hope, honor, and a bright future, turning an ordinary morning into a joyous occasion for the entire household.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. How did the community celebrate Rakesh's success?</p>
        <p>= The community celebrated Rakesh's success with great joy and enthusiasm. People from the neighborhood visited his small yellow house at the end of the road to personally congratulate Rakesh and his proud parents. The house and garden were soon filled with the festive sights and sounds of celebration. Well-wishers brought colorful garlands, wore festive clothes, and offered gifts such as fountain pens and watches. The atmosphere became vibrant and cheerful, resembling a festival, and even sweets like haluwa were shared among the guests to mark the proud moment.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why was Rakesh's success a special matter of discussion in the neighbourhood?</p>
        <p>= Rakesh's success was a special matter of discussion in the neighborhood because he was the first son in the family to receive an  education, and he further topped in the medical examination as well.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. How does the author make fun with the words 'America' and 'the USA'?</p>
        <p>= The author makes fun with the words 'America' and 'the USA' by highlighting Mr. Verma's attitude toward them. When Rakesh won a scholarship to study in the USA, his father insisted that the family refer to the country as “the USA” instead of “America,” because he believed “America” was the term used by ignorant neighbors. He thought “the USA” sounded more educated and prestigious. Through this, the author humorously presents how people sometimes try to sound superior by choosing certain words, even though both terms refer to the same place.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. How does the author characterize Rakesh's wife?</p>
        <p>= The author characterizes Rakesh's wife as an uneducated and old-fashioned woman who is described as plump. She is portrayed as placid, complaisant, and lazy, yet she possesses a good-natured disposition.</p>
        <p className='question'>f. Describe how Rakesh rises in his career.</p>
        <p>= Rakesh's career trajectory is marked by significant achievements and rapid advancement. After completing his medical education, he began his professional journey as a doctor at the city hospital. His dedication and skills allowed him to quickly rise through the ranks of the administrative organization, ultimately becoming the director.
</p><p>
Following this success, Rakesh decided to establish his own private clinic. This move not only showcased his entrepreneurial spirit but also contributed to his reputation as one of the best doctors in the city. Over time, he became known as the richest doctor in town, highlighting both his professional success and financial prosperity.</p>
        <p className='question'>g. How does the author describe Rakesh's family background?</p>
        <p>= The author describes Rakesh's family background as poor and humble. He was born into an economically disadvantaged family in a village in India. His father worked for a kerosene vendor, his mother spent most of her life in the kitchen, and his grandparents were vegetable sellers. Despite their poverty, his parents were determined and made great sacrifices to support Rakesh's education, ultimately helping him attend medical college.</p>
        <p className='question'>h. What is the impact of Rakesh's mother's death on his father?</p>
        <p>= The death of Rakesh's mother had a devastating impact on his father. Along with his retirement, it caused him to emotionally and physically decline. He quickly went to pieces, falling ill frequently and suffering from mysterious complaints described as a peevish whim, which means sudden irritability or mental unrest. Even Rakesh, a doctor, could not understand or cure his father's condition.</p>
        <p className='question'>i. What did Rakesh do to make his father's old age more comfortable?</p>
        <p>= Rakesh took great care to make his father's old age more comfortable. He brought him morning tea in his favorite brass tumbler and sat at the edge of his bed, adjusting his night-shirt and reading out the morning news. He also helped his father down the steps and took him out into the garden for fresh air, making sure he was calm and settled, especially at night. Rakesh also supervised his diet to maintain his health and comfort.</p>
        <p className='question'>j. Why did the old man try to bribe his grandchildren?</p>
        <p>= The old man tried to secretly convince his grandchildren to buy him jalebis and other sweets because he was no longer allowed to eat fried or sugary foods due to health restrictions set by his son. He deeply missed the kind of food his late wife used to make and found it hard to give up those comforts in old age. So, he used small bribes as a clever way to satisfy his cravings without his son knowing.</p>
        <p className='question'>k. Are Mr. Varma's complaints about his diets reasonable? How?</p>
        <p>= Mr. Varma's complaints about his diet can be understood from his point of view, as he was old, emotionally fragile, and missed the food he used to enjoy. To him, being denied his favorite sweets and fried items felt like a loss of joy in his final years. However, from Rakesh's perspective, as both a caring son and a responsible doctor, the restrictions were necessary to protect his father's health. Although the father's complaints may seem reasonable emotionally, they are not entirely justified when considering the medical reasons behind Rakesh's actions.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. How did the Varma couple make sacrifices for their son's higher education?</p>
        <p>= The Varma couple came from a poor and uneducated background. Mr. Varma worked for a kerosene dealer, and Mrs. Varma devoted her life to household work. Despite their limited income and hard lives, they were determined to give their son Rakesh a better future. He was the first in the family to receive a proper education. His parents worked tirelessly and gave up their time, comfort, and money to send him to school and later to medical college. Their sacrifices were driven by love, hope, and the dream of seeing their son succeed in life.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Mr. Varma suffers from diseases one after another after his wife's death. Would he have enjoyed better health if she had not died before him? Give reasons.</p>
        <p>= Yes, it is likely that Mr. Varma would have enjoyed better health if his wife had not passed away before him. Her death deeply affected him both emotionally and physically. After losing her, he became lonely, depressed, and mentally disturbed, which led to a rapid decline in his health. Having spent decades with her, she had become an essential part of his life, and her absence left a painful emptiness. Without her companionship, care, and emotional support, he began to fall ill frequently and suffer from various complaints. This grief and loneliness contributed to his worsening condition. Therefore, if she had been alive, her presence might have brought him comfort and stability, helping him maintain better health in his old age.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Dr Rakesh is divided between a doctor and a son. As a son, he loves his father and worries about his weakening health but as a doctor, he is strict on his father's diet and medicine. In your view, what else could Rakesh have done to make his father's final years more comfortable?</p>
        <p>= Dr. Rakesh is clearly a loving son and a responsible doctor, but sometimes his strictness made his father feel unhappy and controlled. To make his father's final years more comfortable, Rakesh could have been more gentle and respectful in his approach. Instead of insisting rigidly on diet rules, he might have allowed his father some freedom and independence, letting him have a say in how he wanted to live. Giving his father personal space and treating him with kindness and patience, rather than loud reminders or strict commands, would have helped reduce the old man's frustration. This balance of care and respect could have made his father feel more valued and at ease during his later years.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. What does the story say about the relationship between grandfather and grandchildren?</p>
        <p>= The story "A Devoted Son" by Desai portrays a warm and loving relationship between the grandfather and his grandchildren. There is a strong bond of affection and trust between them. The grandfather, missing the sweets and fried foods that his son forbids him from eating, cleverly persuades his grandchildren to bring him jalebis by using their innocence to his advantage. This shows that while their relationship is affectionate and trusting, it also has a playful, sometimes mischievous side. Overall, the story highlights the close, loving, and sometimes playful connection shared between the grandfather and his grandchildren.</p>

      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. Do you call Rakesh a devoted son? Give reasons.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I call Rakesh a devoted son for several reasons. Throughout the story, Rakesh consistently respects and obeys his parents' wishes. He works hard to achieve good academic results, which his parents desire, and even pursues his medical studies abroad in the USA. Despite having the opportunity to earn a higher income abroad, he chooses to return to India to live with and care for his family.
</p><p>
Rakesh shows deep love and respect for his parents. He takes good care of his mother during her illness and personally attends to her until she passes away. After her death, when his father's health begins to decline, Rakesh is worried and takes charge of his father's diet and daily routine, ensuring his comfort and well-being. He uses his medical knowledge to improve his father's health, showing both professional care and filial affection.
</p><p>
Moreover, Rakesh respects his parents' wishes in his personal life as well. Even though he studies abroad, he does not bring a foreign bride home but marries an uneducated, traditional village girl chosen by his mother. This shows his willingness to prioritize his parents' happiness over his own desires.
</p><p>
Though his father sometimes struggles with his son's strict discipline, Rakesh's actions come from a place of love and concern. Overall, Rakesh sacrifices his own wishes to fulfill his responsibilities as a son, husband, and doctor, making him a truly devoted son.</p>

        <p className='question'>a. Write an essay on The Parents' Ambition for their Children in Nepali Society. You must give at least five examples.</p>
        <p>= Parents play an important role in shaping the future of their children. In Nepali society, it is very common for parents to have great ambitions for their children. These ambitions are often driven by a desire to see their children succeed and bring pride to the family. However, sometimes these ambitions become a burden for children if they are forced to follow a path that does not match their own interests and abilities.
</p><p>
One major example is that many parents wish their children to become highly respected professionals such as doctors, engineers, or teachers. In Nepal, these careers are viewed as prestigious and secure, so parents encourage their children to study hard and choose these professions regardless of the child's personal interest. For instance, a child interested in arts or sports might be forced to pursue medicine or engineering simply because the parents believe those careers bring honor.
</p><p>
Another example comes from the agricultural community, which forms a large part of Nepal's population. Many farming families hope their children will continue the farming tradition, using modern tools and technology to improve their agricultural output. They expect their children not only to be successful farmers but also to manage family land efficiently, ensuring the prosperity of future generations.
</p><p>
Business families also have their ambitions. They want their children to join and expand the family business using new knowledge and education. Parents often expect the next generation to increase wealth and reputation by growing the business further, especially if the family is already well-established in the market.
</p><p>
For families living abroad or those with relatives settled in foreign countries, the ambition often shifts towards encouraging children to pursue higher education and better job opportunities abroad. Parents believe that living and working in a foreign country can provide a better standard of living and social status, so they push their children to follow this path.
</p><p>
Politics is another area where parental ambition is seen. Parents involved in politics may want their children to continue the political legacy, holding influential positions to maintain family status and power within the community.
</p><p>
While these ambitions come from a place of love and hope, the problem arises when children are forced to ignore their own talents and passions. Sometimes, pushing children into unwanted paths can lead to stress, frustration, and failure. Therefore, it is important for parents to listen to their children's voices and support them in choosing careers that suit their interests and skills.
</p><p>
In conclusion, parents in Nepali society generally have strong ambitions for their children, often shaped by their backgrounds and professions. However, balancing these ambitions with the children's aspirations is crucial for their overall success and happiness. Parents should act as guides and supporters rather than dictators, helping their children to become confident and fulfilled individuals who contribute positively to society.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Medicines replace our diets in old age. What can be done to make old ageless less dependent on medicine?</p>
        <p>= As people grow older, their bodies naturally become weaker and less efficient. The immune system weakens, and the body struggles to fight off diseases and infections. Often, medicines are used to manage health problems and sometimes even replace proper nutrition because older adults may lose appetite, have difficulty chewing, or have trouble absorbing nutrients. This can make them dependent on medication to stay healthy.
</p><p>
However, there are several ways to reduce this dependence on medicine and help older people maintain good health naturally:
</p><p>
1. Balanced and Nutritious Diet: Older adults should eat well-balanced meals every day that include all food groups — carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Colorful fruits and vegetables (like oranges, carrots, and sweet potatoes), whole grains (such as cereals, rice, and bread), low-fat dairy products fortified with vitamin D, and healthy fats like mustard or olive oil support overall health and bone strength. Foods rich in protein, such as egg whites, help repair cells and tissues.
</p><p>
2. Regular Physical Activity: Exercise plays a vital role in maintaining physical and mental health in old age. Activities like walking, jogging, yoga, stretching, or light sports help strengthen the body, improve circulation, aid digestion, and enhance the absorption of nutrients.
</p><p>
3. Adequate Hydration and Sleep: Drinking plenty of water (about 10-15 glasses daily) prevents dehydration, especially in hot weather. Getting 7-8 hours of restful sleep every night helps the body repair and regenerate.
</p><p>
4. Avoid Harmful Habits: Older adults should avoid smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, and drug use, as these habits worsen health and increase the risk of chronic diseases.
</p><p>
5. Regular Health Check-ups: Staying in touch with healthcare providers and following medical advice helps in early detection and prevention of serious illnesses, reducing the need for excessive medication.
</p><p>
6. Social Engagement: Staying socially active with friends and family can improve emotional well-being and reduce stress, which positively affects physical health.
</p><p>
By following these guidelines, older adults can improve their overall health, reduce their reliance on medicines, and enjoy a better quality of life.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Write an essay on “Care of Elderly Citizens” in about 300 words.</p>
        <p><strong>Care of Elderly Citizens</strong></p><p>
           Elderly citizens refer to people who have crossed middle age and entered the final stage of life. Old age is a sensitive period when a person needs love, affection, and proper care to live comfortably and happily. Caring for the elderly is not only a responsibility but also a moral duty of every individual and society.
</p><p>
As people grow older, they often face health problems and a decline in physical strength. Many elderly people require assistance with basic activities such as walking, eating, bathing, and dressing. Providing them with a safe and homely environment, emotional support, and proper medical care is essential to maintain their well-being.
</p><p>
Unfortunately, in today's busy world, some younger family members consider elderly parents a burden. They may neglect their duties or even send them to old age homes rather than caring for them personally. This attitude is harmful and reflects a lack of respect and gratitude towards the older generation. The elderly have spent their lives shaping and supporting their families, and it is only right to repay their love and sacrifices by taking care of them in their later years.
</p><p>
Caring for elderly citizens involves more than just meeting their physical needs. It also means spending time with them, involving them in family and social activities, and helping them stay mentally active and happy. Regular medical checkups, a healthy diet, and encouragement to stay physically active can greatly improve their quality of life.
</p><p>
In conclusion, old age is a natural part of life, and elderly people deserve our utmost care and respect. As responsible individuals and members of society, we must ensure that our elderly citizens live with dignity, comfort, and happiness.</p>
