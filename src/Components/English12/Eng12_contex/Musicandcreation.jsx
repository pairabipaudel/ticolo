        <p className='question'>C. Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. What does Hellen Keller think about deafness and blindness?</p>
        <p>= Helen Keller believes that blindness separates people from the things around them because they cannot see objects or the world visually. On the other hand, deafness separates people from other people because it prevents them from hearing voices and sounds, which are important for communication and social interaction. Therefore, Keller emphasizes that deafness affects human relationships more deeply than blindness.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Why does the author compare Beethoven with Milton, Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec?</p>
        <p>= The author compares Beethoven with Milton, Van Gogh, and Toulouse-Lautrec because all of these individuals faced significant disabilities or challenges in their lives. Like Beethoven, who became deaf, Milton was blind, and Van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec suffered from physical or mental disabilities. Despite these difficulties, each of them achieved great success and created extraordinary works of art, music, or literature. The comparison highlights their ability to overcome obstacles and contribute profoundly to their fields.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. When and how did Beethoven notice him being deaf?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven noticed that he was becoming deaf around the age of 27. He first realized this when he started losing his ability to hear high-pitched sounds, which is a sign of nerve deafness. Over time, he became aware that his hearing was deteriorating and that he was developing a serious disability.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. What psychological effects did he have when he noticed that he was being deaf?</p>
        <p>= When Beethoven realized he was losing his hearing, he experienced many difficult psychological effects. He felt fear and anxiety about his future, struggled with low self-esteem, and went through emotional turmoil. His growing deafness led to increasing isolation from others, causing him to withdraw socially. He also neglected himself and lost confidence in his ability to work and create music. These feelings made his struggle with deafness even more challenging.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. How did he triumph over his suicidal thoughts?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven overcame his suicidal thoughts by relying on his strong personal values and deep passion for music. He believed in the importance of living a meaningful life and found inspiration in the idea that a person should not give up easily because they still have many good things to do. This belief, along with his dedication to composing music, motivated him to fight his despair and continue living with hope and purpose.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. How did he accept his deafness?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven accepted his deafness by realizing that no one could save him from it. He understood that if he wanted to continue living and creating music, he had to accept his condition and find a way to move forward despite it. This acceptance helped him face his challenges with courage and determination.</p>

        <p className='question'>g. How was his deafness ironically good for the world?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven's deafness was ironically good for the world because it led to greater creativity within him. Being unable to hear external sounds allowed him to focus deeply on his inner thoughts, feelings, and musical ideas without distractions. This intense inner listening helped him compose some of the most powerful and original music in history, enriching the world with his masterpieces.</p>

        <p className='question'>h. When did Beethoven give up his musical performances forever?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven gave up performing music publicly forever in his mid-forties. At that time, his increasing deafness made it very difficult and embarrassing for him to perform, so he decided to stop giving public performances.</p>

        <p className='question'>i. What did Stephen von Breeuning comment on Beethoven's reactions?</p>
        <p>= In 1804, during a rehearsal for the Eroica Symphony, Beethoven had trouble hearing the wind instruments because of his deafness. His friend, Stephen von Breuning, observed that Beethoven had become withdrawn and began to mistrust even his closest friends due to the difficulties he was facing.</p>

        <p className='question'>j. How did Beethoven express the conflict in his mind?</p>
        <p>= Beethoven expressed the conflict in his mind by withdrawing from social gatherings and isolating himself. He became mistrustful of even his closest friends and struggled with repeated thoughts of suicide as he grappled with his growing deafness and emotional pain.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Suicidal thoughts came in Beethoven's mind several times but he did not commit suicide and kept on composing music. Write a monologue in about 150 words from Beethoven's perspectives describing his suicidal thoughts and his will to live.</p>
        <p>= I was the life of the party even when there was no party. I made one happen. I made people laugh. I made myself laugh. Lord, you could hear my laugh from a block away.
</p><p>
“Isn't he something, that Beethoven?” people would say. “Always happy. Always with a smile.” But inside, I feel lonely and helpless. My deafness has isolated me from friends and family. They see me only as the deaf man, not the musician I am. All my efforts to bring music to life, to make the world proud, seem wasted. Sometimes, I cannot bear it. No hope of a cure, no end to this pain. It wears me out. Today, I stayed alone. I thought maybe I would just stop. Rest forever.</p>
<p>But then I realized suicide is not the answer. Life is precious. I still have music inside me. I may not hear others, but I will listen to my inner sounds and feelings. I will live, I will create. I am not defeated.</p>

        <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Was it divine inspiration or rigorous practice that made Beethoven one of the world's greatest musicians? Give the reasons.</p>
        <p>= It was not divine inspiration alone, but Beethoven's rigorous practice, deep dedication, and unbreakable belief in music that made him one of the greatest composers in history. Ludwig van Beethoven, a German pianist and composer, is widely recognized for transforming the world of music. His groundbreaking compositions expanded the boundaries of musical forms like the sonata, symphony, concerto, and string quartet.</p>
        <p>Beethoven's life was filled with personal hardships, especially his struggle with deafness. Even when he was almost completely unable to hear, he continued to compose some of his most powerful and influential works. His determination to keep creating despite such a painful condition reflects his extraordinary commitment to music.</p>
        <p>Instead of giving up, he pushed through suffering, channeling his emotions into his music. It was through consistent hard work, creativity, and passion that he not only achieved global recognition but also reshaped the course of Western music. Beethoven didn't just follow an era he created his own</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>Who is your favourite Nepali musician? Write his/her biography in about 300 words.</p>
        <p>= Narayan Gopal is my favourite Nepali musician. He is considered one of the greatest and most respected singers in the history of Nepali music. Born on October 4, 1939, in Kathmandu, Narayan Gopal Guruwacharya belonged to a Newar family. From a young age, he had a deep interest in music, and though his parents wanted him to focus on academics, his heart was always in singing.
</p><p>
Narayan Gopal's voice was very unique, strong, emotional, and full of life. He didn't just sing; he made people feel every word. His songs are filled with emotions like love, pain, loneliness, and hope. That's why people of all generations still listen to him today.
</p><p>
Some of his most popular songs are “Euta Manche Ko Maya,” “Yeti Dherai Maya Dii,” “Timro Jasto Mutu,” and “Saawan ko jhari.” These songs are timeless and touch the heart, no matter how many times you listen to them.
</p><p>
Narayan Gopal worked closely with other talented lyricists and composers like Gopal Yonjan. Together, they gave Nepali music a new height. He also helped bring change to the Nepali music industry, making it more professional and respected.
</p><p>
Even though he passed away on December 5, 1990, his music still lives in the hearts of millions. He may not be with us physically, but his voice and songs continue to inspire and heal. For me, Narayan Gopal is not just a singer, he is a legend whose voice carries the soul of Nepal.</p>
