        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>"Facing Death" is a heart-touching one-act play written by August Strindberg. It tells the story of an old man named Durand, who lives with his three daughters—Adele, Annette, and Therese. Life has been very hard for them. The family used to be well-off, but now they are struggling with poverty, and the daughters often complain about their father. They think he's lazy and useless because he doesn't work and can't provide them with a better life.
</p><p>
But what the daughters don't understand is that Durand has sacrificed everything for them. He once gave up his own business to save their mother's family, and after her death, he tried his best to raise the girls alone. However, they never appreciated his love, and now they treat him coldly. Deep inside, Durand is hurt, lonely, and heartbroken, but he never stops loving them.
</p><p>
Durand knows that he cannot offer them a better future while he's alive. So, in the most painful and selfless decision of all, he decides to take his own life so that his daughters can receive insurance money after his death. He carefully plans it to look like an accident so that they won't lose the claim. At the end of the play, he drinks poisoned tea—choosing death, not because he wants to escape, but because he wants to give his daughters one last gift: a better life.</p>

        <p>= The grocery, the baker, and the butcher send their bills to the Durand household because Monsieur Durand has not paid them for a long time.

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Sketch the character of Monsieur Duran.</p>
        <p>= Monsieur Durand is the central character in the play Facing Death by August Strindberg. He is a widower and the owner of a lodge, where he lives with his three daughters. Formerly a railway worker, Durand now struggles financially because he has turned his home into a boarding house to make ends meet. Despite his difficult situation, he is a loving and caring father who deeply worries about his family's future.
</p><p>
Though his daughters often blame and treat him harshly, Durand's love for them never fades. He carries the sadness of losing his son and feels the weight of his family's troubles on his shoulders. Even though life has become hard and lonely for him, he remains protective and devoted.
</p><p>
In the play, Durand shows great sacrifice. Knowing the family is drowning in debt and has no hope left, he decides to take his own life by poisoning himself and burning the house to claim insurance money. He does this painful act out of love, hoping the money will help his daughters survive after he is gone. Monsieur Durand is a tragic hero who endures hardship and makes the ultimate sacrifice for his family's well-being.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. How do we know that the Duran family has reached a dead end?</p>
        <p>= We know that the Durand family has reached a dead end by looking at the series of problems they face throughout the play. Monsieur Durand and his family are completely bankrupt, having lost their ancestral property due to his wife's careless and foolish financial decisions. To survive, Durand has turned his own house into a boarding lodge, but even that doesn't bring enough money.
</p><p>
The family is drowning in debt, with unpaid bills piling up from the grocer, baker, and butcher. Durand is under constant pressure from creditors but has no means to pay them back. His daughters blame him for their misery, even though it was their mother's reckless actions that caused their financial ruin. The relationship between Durand and his daughters is strained and unhappy.
</p><p>
The family is living in extreme poverty, barely able to afford food, sometimes resorting to eating rats to survive. Faced with no hope and overwhelmed by debt, Durand plans to end his life by drinking poison and burning down the house so that the insurance money can provide for his daughters. This tragic plan shows clearly that the Durand family has reached a dead end with no way out except through sacrifice.
</p><p>
This combination of financial ruin, broken relationships, and despair makes it clear that the Durand family is trapped in a hopeless situation.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. 'The mother, though already dead, seems to have had a great influence on the daughters, especiallyTheresa.' Do you agree?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I agree that the mother, though already dead, had a great influence on her daughters, especially Theresa. When she was alive, she often blamed Monsieur Durand for their family's problems and taught her daughters to hate him. She forced them to obey her and shaped their negative attitude toward their father.
</p><p>
After the mother's death, Monsieur Durand stayed silent and did not try to change his daughters' opinions because he wanted to protect their mother's reputation. But because of what their mother taught them, the daughters continued to blame and hate their father. Theresa, in particular, shows this influence clearly through her rude and disrespectful behavior toward him—like throwing away his matches or snatching his milk.
</p><p>
However, it can also be argued that the elder daughter, Adele, is more influenced by their mother's memory since she openly supports her mother's views and argues with her father more than Theresa does. Theresa does not argue as much in defense of their mother, so the mother's influence might be stronger on Adele.
</p><p>
Overall, the mother's influence on the daughters is strong and continues even after her death, shaping their attitude toward their father, but it may affect each daughter differently.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>d. Discuss the relationship between Monsieur Duran and his wife.</p>
        <p>= Monsieur Durand and his wife did not have a good relationship. Although they had a love marriage and lived abroad, their marriage was full of problems. Mrs. Durand was careless and made foolish financial decisions, like gambling and reckless speculations, which ruined the family's inherited property. Despite causing this damage, she often blamed her husband for their troubles.
</p><p>
Throughout their married life, Monsieur Durand carried the burden of her mistakes and took responsibility for the consequences. Mrs. Durand's behavior was harsh—she even threatened to become a prostitute to get money when she was beaten. She also influenced their daughters negatively by teaching them to hate their father and filling their minds with resentment against him.
</p><p>
Because of her strong influence, the daughters sided with their mother and refused to listen to anything against her. Overall, Monsieur Durand and his wife had a troubled and loveless relationship. The mother's impact on the family was so strong that it created lasting tension between the daughters and their father, which becomes clear in the play's final scenes.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. 'Money determines the relationship between characters in this play.' Elaborate this statementwithexamples from the play.</p>
        <p>= The statement “Money determines the relationship between characters in this play” is very true when we look closely at Facing Death. Money plays a central role in shaping how the characters interact with each other. Monsieur Durand and his daughters suffer from severe financial problems that affect every part of their lives. Because they don't have enough money, they struggle to meet basic needs like food and shelter. This lack of money causes tension and bitterness in the family.
</p><p>
For example, Monsieur Durand has to turn his own home into a lodge to earn money, showing how desperate their situation is. The baker, the grocer, and the butcher refuse to give them supplies because Durand has unpaid bills. The daughters are angry and disrespectful toward their father, blaming him for their poverty and harsh life. They think he wastes money or is careless, even though it was their mother's poor decisions that ruined the family's finances.
</p><p>
Interestingly, when the daughters learn about the fire insurance money Monsieur Durand hopes to get, their attitude changes and they start to show love and concern for him. This shows that their relationships are closely tied to money. When they see a chance for financial gain, their feelings change. In short, money is the main force that influences how the characters treat each other, whether with hate, blame, or sudden affection. The whole play revolves around how poverty and money problems affect family bonds, making this statement very accurate.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. Monsieur Duran kills himself so that his daughters would get 5000 francs as the compensation from theinsurancecompany. What does his plan tell us about him?</p>
        <p>= Monsieur Durand kills himself so that his daughters can receive 5,000 francs as compensation from the insurance company. This plan shows how deeply he loves and cares for his daughters. Despite living a life full of hardship, sadness, and hunger, Durand thinks about their future and wants to secure their financial well-being even after his death.
</p><p>
In the play Facing Death, Durand is portrayed as a tragic hero. He has faced many difficulties, including being blamed by his wife and daughters for their financial problems, even though much of the blame lies elsewhere. He sacrifices himself because he believes this is the only way to provide for his daughters and help them overcome their struggles.
</p><p>
His plan reveals that he is a kind, devoted, and responsible father who puts his family's needs above his own life. Even though he feels unloved and misunderstood, his concern for his daughters' future never fades. This selfless act highlights the depth of his love and the lengths he is willing to go to protect and support them financially.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>g. Discuss Facing Death as a modern tragedy.</p>
        <p>= Modern tragedy focuses on the struggles and oppression faced by ordinary people rather than the fate of kings or nobles. It deals with realistic social, economic, and psychological problems, often ending in the downfall or suffering of the protagonist. The play Facing Death by August Strindberg is a modern tragedy because it portrays the tragic fate of Monsieur Durand, an ordinary man overwhelmed by financial hardship and family conflict, ultimately leading to his death.
</p><p>
Unlike classical tragedies that revolve around fame or royal destiny, modern tragedy emphasizes real-life issues such as poverty, loneliness, mental distress, and social struggles. The protagonist is usually a common person facing the harsh realities of life. This type of tragedy is characterized by realism and naturalism, presenting life as it is, often bleak and unforgiving.
</p><p>
Monsieur Durand is a typical “common man” trapped by socio-economic problems. He is a widower, financially ruined, hated by his daughters, and forced to turn his home into a lodge to survive. Despite his love for his family, he faces rejection and blame. His downfall, ending in suicide and the burning of his house to secure money for his daughters through insurance, highlights the tragic reality of many common people's lives.
</p><p>
The changing attitude of the daughters—from hatred due to poverty to interest when money is involved—reflects harsh societal realities about family relationships and materialism. This mirrors modern society, where financial status often influences familial love and care. The play's exploration of these themes and the tragic end of an ordinary man make Facing Death a strong example of modern tragedy.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Write a few paragraphs describing the role of the father in the family.</p>
        <p>= While both parents play equally important roles, the father is often seen as an instrumental and key figure in the modern family, traditionally regarded as the head of the household. The specific tasks and responsibilities of a father may vary according to cultural backgrounds, but across cultures, the fundamental duties expected of a father remain largely similar.
</p><p>
A father should always be present for his wife and children, providing the much-needed love and support. Showing love is not merely about providing financial resources; it also involves offering emotional comfort, listening attentively, and spending both quality and quantity time with family members. These interactions are crucial for creating strong emotional bonds, which form the foundation of a healthy family relationship.
</p><p>
The presence of a father figure significantly influences the life and well-being of a child. Fathers often serve as one of the first male role models children encounter, shaping their understanding of relationships with men. Children are sensitive and observant, internalizing their early experiences, which later serve as a blueprint for future relationships. Unhealthy or absent father-child relationships can negatively impact a child's psychological well-being and affect their relational choices in adulthood.
</p><p>
Therefore, the father's role includes being a loving and supportive spouse and parent. Many children regard their fathers as heroes, earning their respect and love. Fathers help set rules, enforce discipline, and provide guidance. Their involvement promotes inner growth, confidence, and emotional strength in children.
</p><p>
Traditionally, the father is responsible for working and providing for the family's needs, as well as administering discipline when necessary. Fathers ensure their children have a secure and nurturing environment, offering both physical and emotional comfort in difficult times. They help build self-esteem and prepare children for the realities of life. While societal roles are evolving, with fathers sharing household duties and mothers pursuing careers, fathers continue to provide a sense of security, especially to daughters. They influence the kinds of friendships and relationships their children form. Overall, the father is responsible for providing financial support, food, shelter, and emotional stability for the family.</p>
