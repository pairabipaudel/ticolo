      <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
      <div className="qa">
        <p className='question'><>a.</> Have you made your own precept after you read this lesson? What is it? Share it with your friends.</p>
        <p>
          Yes, after reading this lesson, I have created my own precept. A precept is a rule or principle that guides our behavior and thoughts.<br />
          <p>My Precept:</p><br />
          "When given a choice between being right or being kind, I choose kindness."<br />
          I believe kindness is more important than always proving we are right. Being kind helps build good relationships and makes the world a better place. Sometimes, winning an argument is less valuable than showing compassion and understanding toward others.

        <p className='question'><>b.</> According to Josh Lanyon, "If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity." Justify this statement with your logic.</p>
        <p>
          Josh Lanyon said, “If there was one life skill everyone on the planet needed, it was the ability to think with critical objectivity.” This means that the most important skill for all people is the ability to think clearly, logically, and without bias.<br /><br />
          Critical objectivity refers to the ability to analyze situations and information carefully, separating facts from emotions or assumptions, and making fair, reasoned judgments. It is closely connected to critical thinking skills such as analysis, interpretation, inference, explanation, and open-mindedness.<br /><br />
          Throughout history, human progress and development have depended on people's ability to think critically and objectively. Whether inventing new tools, solving problems, or making decisions, success comes when people can evaluate situations without letting personal feelings or biases cloud their judgment.<br /><br />
          Life skills such as problem-solving, decision-making, and creativity depend on this ability to think critically. For example, creative thinking requires not only new ideas but also the ability to assess those ideas objectively and choose the best solutions.<br /><br />
          Without critical objectivity, people may act on incorrect assumptions, biases, or misinformation, leading to poor decisions. On the other hand, thinking objectively allows us to learn from experience, improve ourselves, and make better choices in life.<br /><br />
          Therefore, Josh Lanyon's statement is justified because critical objectivity is the foundation of all other life skills. It enables us to face challenges wisely, adapt to changes, and contribute positively to our world.

          Subject: An Interesting Class Experience to Share!<br /><br />

          Hi [Friend's Name],<br /><br />

          I hope you are doing well! I was really happy to receive your email this morning and to hear about your achievements. It feels great to stay connected even when we are busy.<br /><br />

          I wanted to share an interesting experience I had recently in one of my classes. The day before yesterday, our girls' group decided to join a language class at a nearby institute. When we arrived, we waited in the classroom for about half an hour before the teacher came in.<br /><br />

          He was a tall, friendly man who greeted us warmly, as if we were old friends. He introduced himself and even asked for our names. What impressed me the most was his excellent English accent and fluent speaking style—it felt like we were listening to a native speaker! He used jokes and funny gestures to make the class lively and enjoyable.<br /><br />

          In just half an hour, he taught us the general way to introduce ourselves in English. The environment was so friendly and encouraging that we all felt confident and eager to learn more. By the end of the class, we had already decided to enroll in a three-month basic course with him.<br /><br />

          This class was not only fun but also very helpful, and I'm excited about improving my English skills.<br /><br />

          How about you? Have you had any interesting classes recently? Write back when you get a chance!<br /><br />

          Take care and stay safe,<br />
