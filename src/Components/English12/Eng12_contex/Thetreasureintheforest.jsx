        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The Treasure in the Forest is a suspenseful adventure story about two British men, Evans and Hooker, who embark on a risky journey to find hidden Spanish treasure on a tropical island. The two “stranded British wastrels” steal a treasure map from a Chinese man named Chang-hi, whom they murder during the theft. Chang-hi had discovered the treasure left behind by a shipwrecked galleon and had reburied it at a secret location marked on the map. However, part of the map is covered with mysterious little dashes pointing in every direction, puzzling Evans and Hooker.
</p><p>
Following the map, the men reach the island and venture into the dense forest, where they find a pile of stones marking the treasure's location. Nearby lies the swollen, purple body of another Chinese man, who appears to have been searching for the treasure himself. As Evans begins to collect the gold bars, he is pricked by a thorn hidden among the treasure. Soon after, Hooker is also pricked by a similar thorn. They realize too late that the treasure was protected by poisonous thorns, as indicated by the dashes on the map.
</p><p>
Both men suffer from the poison's effects and die beside each other, their greed and recklessness leading to their downfall. The story warns readers about the dangers of taking risks without proper preparation and how greed can cloud judgment and bring destruction. It vividly portrays the consequences of greed and the perils of venturing into unknown and dangerous territory without caution.</p>

        <p className='question'>a.Describe the expository scene of the story.</p>
        <p>= The story opens with two treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker, approaching the land in a canoe. As they move closer, they see a thick and dense green forest, a sloping hill, and a small river flowing into the sea. The setting paints a vivid picture of a wild, natural environment where the treasure hunt is about to begin.</p>
        <p className='question'>b.What does the map look like and how do Evan and Hooker interpret it?</p>
        <p>= The map looks very old, rough, creased, and worn out from folding, with some parts almost tearing. It has twisting lines, stars, and dotted lines. Evan interprets the twisting lines as a river and the star as the exact location of the treasure. On the other hand, Hooker focuses on the dotted lines and straight lines, seeing them as paths leading to the lagoon. Both interpret different parts of the map according to their own understanding.</p>
        <p className='question'>c.How did Evan and Hooker know about the treasure?</p>
        <p>= Evan and Hooker learned about the treasure by overhearing a secret conversation between Chinese men and by obtaining the map that showed the location of the treasure.</p>
        <p className='question'>d.Describe Evan's dream.</p>
        <p>= During their journey, Evan began to doze and had a vivid dream. In the dream, he found himself in a forest near a small fire where three Chinese men were sitting and speaking quietly in English. Evan moved closer and learned that Chang-hi had taken gold from a Spanish galleon that had been shipwrecked and had carefully hidden it on the island. Chang-hi had worked alone, keeping the treasure a secret, but now he wanted help to retrieve it. Suddenly, there was a fierce battle, and Chang-hi was brutally killed by the others. Just as Evan heard someone calling his name, he suddenly woke up.</p>
        <p className='question'>e.What do the two treasure hunters see when they walk towards the island?</p>
        <p>= As the two treasure hunters walk towards the island, they see three palm trees lined up near the mouth of a stream, surrounded by thick bushes and dim white flowers. They also discover the dead body of a Chinese man named Chang-hi, which surprises them greatly. Additionally, they notice a gap in the dense forest where shafts of sunlight filter through, lighting the somber surroundings.</p>
        <p className='question'>f.In what condition did the treasure hunters find the dead man?</p>
        <p>= When Evan and Hooker reached the place where the treasure was buried, they found a dead man lying in a clear space among the trees. The man's neck was puffed and purple, and his hands and ankles were swollen, indicating that he had suffered severe physical distress before his death.</p>
        <p className='question'>g.How did the treasure hunters try to carry gold ingots to the canoe?</p>
        <p>= The treasure hunters, having no proper container to carry the gold ingots, used a coat to transport them. Hooker held one end of the coat's collar while Evan held the other, allowing them to lift and carry the gold ingots together to the canoe.</p>
        <p className='question'>h.How were Evan and Hooker poisoned?</p>
        <p>= Evan and Hooker were poisoned when a slender, nearly two-inch-long thorn pricked Hooker's thumb. As Evan rolled over him, both of them collapsed to the ground, suffering greatly from the effects of the poison that entered their bodies through the puncture wound.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a.How do you know the story is set on a tropical island?</p>
        <p>= The story “The Treasures in the Forest” is set on a tropical island, which is evident from the detailed descriptions provided by the author. It begins with two men, Evans and Hooker, paddling a canoe toward a coral island under the heat of the noon sun, indicating a warm and tropical climate. The narrator describes the island's thick, green forests filled with palm trees and thorny bushes, freshwater streams flowing into the sea, white surf breaking on coral reefs, and sloping hills covered with virgin forest. These features, along with the presence of mangroves, coastal forests, seagrass beds, and diverse ecosystems such as tropical rainforests, open woodlands, and salt marshes, are characteristic of tropical islands. The combination of these natural elements and the hot atmosphere clearly shows that the story is set on a tropical island.</p>
<hr/>
        <p className='question'>b.Why do you think Evan and Hooker took such a risk of finding the buried treasure in a desert island?</p>
        <p>= Evan and Hooker took the risk of searching for buried treasure on a deserted island mainly because of their greed for wealth. The idea of finding a treasure left behind by a shipwrecked galleon, potentially worth millions, excited and tempted them greatly. They saw the challenge and dangers involved as worth the reward, believing that the risk was justified by the possibility of immense riches. Their desire for gold clouded their judgment, making them willing to face the unknown and hazardous conditions of the island. Additionally, treasure hunting often appeals to people's adventurous spirit and problem-solving skills, but in their case, it was primarily driven by the lure of wealth and the belief that the risk would pay off. As the saying goes, “Gold makes people crazy,” and this was clearly true for Evan and Hooker.</p>
<hr/>
        <p className='question'>c.Do you think the narrator of the story is racist? If yes, what made him feel superior to other races?</p>
        <p>= Yes, the narrator of the story does exhibit some racist attitudes. This is evident in the way Evans and Hooker are portrayed as superior to the Chinese man, who is depicted in a negative and marginalized manner. The Chinese man is brutally killed by Evans and Hooker, yet the narrator gives little attention or sympathy to him, which suggests a biased viewpoint. Additionally, the dominance displayed by Hooker over Evans, reflected in the line “Have you lost your wit?”, further emphasizes a power hierarchy that aligns with racial superiority. These elements indicate that the narrator's perspective may be prejudiced, showing a sense of superiority toward certain races while marginalizing others.</p>
<hr/>
        <p className='question'>d.What do you think is the moral of the story?</p>
        <p>= The moral of the story “The Treasure in the Forest” is that greed can lead to destruction and ruin. Evan and Hooker's intense desire for wealth drives them to take extreme risks, including brutally killing the Chinese man to get to the treasure. Their greed clouds their judgment and ultimately causes their downfall when they are poisoned by the very gold they sought. The story warns that the pursuit of money and power at any cost can bring harm not only to others but also to oneself. Instead of chasing after greed, we should focus on being content with what we have and pursue our goals with honesty and caution. This tale teaches us that excessive greed is dangerous and can lead to tragic consequences.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Interpret the story as a mystery story. </p>
        <p>= The story “The Treasures in the Forest” can be interpreted as a mystery story because it is filled with suspense, unexpected twists, and eerie events that keep the reader guessing. The plot revolves around two treasure hunters, Evans and Hooker, who murder a Chinese man named Chang-hi to steal a treasure map, yet the victim's mysterious grin at the moment of death raises questions about what he knew. As they journey by canoe to a coral island following the map, they encounter strange and fearful surroundings, including the discovery of a dead Chinese man's body at the treasure site. The story builds tension through the poisonous thorns that prick them, leading to their painful deaths. The suspense about the true nature of the treasure, the significance of Chang-hi's grin, and the deadly consequences of their greed make the story a compelling mystery, where nothing is as simple or straightforward as it seems.</p>
        <hr/>
        <p className='question'>b. Treasure hunting is a favorable subject of children's story. Remember a treasure hunting story you read in your childhood and compare and contrast it with 'The Treasure in the Forest.'</p>
        <p>= I have read a treasure hunting story named “The Gold Bug” by Edgar Allan Poe, which I can compare and contrast with “The Treasures in the Forest.” Both stories involve mysterious treasure hunts on remote islands and feature unnamed narrators, creating suspense and intrigue. In “The Gold Bug,” William Legrand uses a pet dog to help locate the treasure on a marshy island in South Carolina, while in “The Treasures in the Forest,” Evans and Hooker rely on a map to find treasure on a tropical island with thick forests and freshwater streams.
</p><p>
The treasure in “The Gold Bug” is estimated to be worth about one and a half million dollars, highlighting themes of wealth and fortune. In contrast, “The Treasures in the Forest” focuses more on the destructive nature of greed and power, as Evans and Hooker's pursuit of treasure leads to betrayal, murder, and ultimately their demise. While both stories revolve around treasure hunting, “The Gold Bug” carries a tone of adventure and mystery, whereas “The Treasures in the Forest” serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of greed. Additionally, “The Gold Bug” uses a clever puzzle involving cryptography, while “The Treasures in the Forest” relies on suspenseful events like poisonous thorns and the eerie grin of a murdered man to build tension.</p>
