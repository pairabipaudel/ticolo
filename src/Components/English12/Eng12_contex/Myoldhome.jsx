        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The story “My Old Home” is about a man who returns to his hometown after living away for many years. He is around 30 years old and has been working in another city. Now, he comes back because his family is selling their old house. His mother and nephew are still living there, and they are preparing to move to another place where life might be easier.
</p><p>
When the narrator arrives, he looks around the house where he grew up. Everything feels different. The rooms seem smaller, and the yard is no longer filled with sunlight and joy. It feels darker, colder, and lifeless. He feels sad because the memories of his happy childhood don't match what he sees now. Time has changed everything.
</p><p>
He talks with his mother, who tells him that the old servant and his childhood friend Runtu will come to visit. Hearing Runtu's name brings back memories of when they were kids. Runtu was the son of a poor laborer and worked for the narrator's family. But even with the difference in class, they had been very close as children. They used to play together in the fields, collect shells, hunt for birds, and talk about everything.
</p><p>
The narrator remembers Runtu as cheerful and full of energy. But when Runtu finally arrives, he is not the same anymore. He looks older, tired, and burdened by a hard life. He has many children and struggles to feed his family. When they talk, it feels awkward. Runtu now sees the narrator as someone from a higher class, not as his friend. He speaks formally and calls him “Master,” showing the distance between them.
</p><p>
Runtu doesn't ask for anything directly, but the narrator's mother understands and gives him some old furniture and things they don't need. Runtu takes them gratefully. The narrator feels the pain of how time and society have changed their bond.
</p><p>
The narrator also spends time with his young nephew, Shuan, who is still innocent and full of life. He starts to hope that maybe the new generation like Shuan will grow up in a better world, where people are equal, where friendships are not broken by class or money, and where people can truly understand and support one another.
</p><p>
As the narrator leaves the old home for the last time, he looks back with mixed feelings, sadness for what is lost, but also a little hope for the future.

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following question</p>
        <p>a. How does the narrator describe his feeling at the arrival of his old home?</p>
        <p>= When the narrator arrives at his old home, he experiences a mixture of emotions. Initially, he feels pleasure and happiness, recalling the lovely memories of his childhood when the sky was green and full of life. However, upon arrival, he is overwhelmed by a deep sense of depression and disappointment because the place has changed drastically. The vibrant green sky has turned into a vast, greying, and gloomy expanse, and the surroundings appear deserted and lifeless. There are no signs of progress or development, and the condition of his home is poor. This stark contrast between his nostalgic memories and the present reality fills him with sadness and a sense of loss.</p>
        <p>b. What were the three kinds of servants in China then? What does it indicate about contemporary Chinese society?</p>
        <p>=The three kinds of servants in China at that time were:
</p><p>
1. Dailies (Short-timers): These were day laborers who worked only for a day or a short period.
</p><p>
2. Yearlongs (Full-timers): Servants who worked for the same family throughout the year or longer.
</p><p>
3. Busy-mothers (Part-timers): Landowners who farmed their own land but worked for a particular family only during special occasions like New Year's festivals or when rent was due.
</p><p>
This division of servants indicates that contemporary Chinese society had a clear social hierarchy and an entrenched system of labor division. It reflects inequality and a form of servitude or slavery where people's work and status were strictly categorized based on their social and economic positions.</p>
        <p>c. What makes the narrator nostalgic? What did he do with Runtu in his teenage years?</p>
        <p>= The narrator becomes nostalgic when his mother asks him to meet his childhood friend Runtu, which brings back memories of their shared past. In their teenage years, the narrator and Runtu spent time together catching birds using tricks and hunting the Zha by stabbing it. They also collected colorful shells like reds, blues, and ghost-scarers. Additionally, they went out looking for animals such as badgers and porcupines. The respectful and formal way Runtu addressed the narrator as "Master" or "Brother Xun" also adds to the narrator's nostalgic feelings, reminding him of the close and respectful bond they shared during their youth.</p>
        <p>d. How did Runtu hunt a Zha at a young age?</p>
        <p>= At a young age, Runtu hunted a Zha by suddenly attacking it with a pointed knife or stabbing it with a pitchfork while he was standing guard over watermelons.

Different obligations and social division play the most important role behind his poverty.

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. While reading the friendship between the narrator and Runtu, Hindu readers remember the friendship between Krishna and Sudama. Which particular description reminds you of the mythological example?</p>
        <p>= The friendship between Xun and Runtu in the story reminds Hindu readers of the mythological friendship between Krishna and Sudama, as described in the Mahabharata. In both stories, the friendship is based on love, respect, and a pure heart—not on wealth or social status. One specific description that reminds us of the Krishna-Sudama story is when Runtu, who is now poor and struggling to meet even his basic needs, feels shy and hesitant to meet his old friend Xun, who has become wealthy. This is similar to how Sudama felt ashamed to visit Krishna, thinking that his poverty made him unworthy of his friend's royal status.</p>
        <p>Another moment that reflects this mythological friendship is the way Xun warmly welcomes Runtu without caring about his poor condition. Just like Krishna lovingly welcomed Sudama and even transformed his life by giving him everything he needed, Xun also offers Runtu household goods and help to improve his difficult life. Both stories show that real friendship does not depend on material things, but on kindness, loyalty, and understanding. These examples remind us that true friends are always there to support each other, no matter how much time has passed or how different their lives have become.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. How does the story support the proposition that the relationships of childhood are innocent, impartial and disinterested?</p>
        <p>= The story My Old Home shows that childhood friendships are pure, honest, and fair. In childhood, children do not care about who is rich or poor, high class or low class. They make friends just to play and be happy. They don't expect anything in return. Their love and care are real and not based on selfish reasons. They don't think about money, power, or status. That's why childhood relationships are called innocent and disinterested.</p>
        <p>In the story, Xun and Runtu were very good friends when they were young. They used to play together and enjoy each other's company. At that time, it didn't matter that Xun was from a rich family and Runtu was poor. But when they grew up, life changed. Runtu became very poor, and Xun became richer. Still, Xun helped Runtu by giving him useful things like a table and incense burner. This shows that their friendship was still alive in their hearts.</p>
        <p>So, the story proves that real friendship in childhood is full of love and kindness. Even when people grow up and face many problems, the bond made in childhood can stay strong and true.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. After reading the story, what inferences can you make about the contemporary Chinese economic and social system?</p>
        <p>= The story My Old Home gives us a picture of the old Chinese society and its economic and social conditions. It tells us about the value of friendship, the life of common people, and the differences between rich and poor. The friendship between Xun and Runtu shows how two people from different classes could still care for each other, even though society tried to separate them.</p>
        <p>From the story, we can understand that farming was the main job of most people. But farming did not give them enough money, so they struggled even to feed their families. This shows that the economy of China at that time was very weak for common people, especially for farmers.</p>
        <p>The story also shows the social structure of that time. Society was divided into rich and poor classes. Rich families had servants who worked full-time, part-time, or only during special times like holidays. They were called Yearlongs, short-timers, and busy-mothers. Poor people had very few rights and were not treated equally. People from different classes were not allowed to be close or friendly, which shows the social discrimination and unfair treatment that existed in that period. This tells us that the old Chinese society was very strict and divided by wealth and class.</p>

         <div>
        <p className='question'>d. What does the story indicate about the geographical features of the narrator's hometown?</p>
        <p>= The story My Old Home describes the narrator's hometown in a very emotional and nostalgic way. It is set in the winter of 1921 in ancient China. In his childhood, the narrator remembers the place as beautiful, green, and full of life. The sky above was deep blue-black, the land was covered with green grass and vegetables, and birds used to fly around freely. There was also a seaside nearby where he used to collect colorful shells. These memories show that his hometown once had a peaceful and rich natural environment.</p>
        <p>However, when the narrator returns after many years, he sees that everything has changed. The green and lively place has become dull and grey. The sky looks lifeless, and the area feels empty and sad. There is no sign of growth or progress. It appears that development and time have damaged the natural beauty of the place.</p>
        <p>The story shows how the environment and atmosphere of the narrator's hometown have changed over time. It reflects the effects of climate change, neglect, and poor development. The beauty of the land, the joy of nature, and the connection to his past are now lost. This change deeply hurts the narrator and makes him feel that the place is no longer the same.</p>

          <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
          <p className='question'>a. Human beings are on the road from time immemorial, always migrating to new places. Write an essay on The Trend of Migration in Nepal in about 300 words.</p>
          <p><strong>The Trend of Migration in Nepal</strong></p>
           <p>Migration means moving from one place to another. In Nepal, many people leave their villages and go to cities or foreign countries. This happens because of problems like unemployment, low income, poor education, and lack of health services in rural areas. People want a better life, so they move to places where they can find jobs and good facilities.</p>
           <p>A large number of Nepali youths go abroad to work, especially in countries like Qatar, Malaysia, and South Korea. They send money back home, which helps their families and supports Nepal's economy. Many people also move from villages to big cities like Kathmandu and Pokhara. They want better schools, hospitals, and modern lifestyles. This has made cities crowded and villages empty.</p>
           <p>Migration has both good and bad sides. It gives people better opportunities and income, but it also causes problems. Villages lose young people and are left with only the elderly. Families live apart for many years. Cities become overcrowded and polluted. To reduce these problems, the government should create jobs and improve services in rural areas so people don't have to leave their homes.</p>
          </div>
         <div>
           <p>b. Find one of your relatives or friends, who has migrated to a new place leaving his/her old home. Talk to him/her and prepare a report on what he/she felt while leaving the old home.</p>
            <p><strong>Report on Leaving the Old Home</strong></p>
            <p>I talked to my cousin, Sita, who moved from our village to Kathmandu for work. She shared her feelings about leaving her old home and starting a new life in the city.</p>
            <p>Sita said that leaving her old home was very emotional and difficult. She felt sad because she had to leave her family, friends, and the peaceful village life she was used to. She missed the green fields, fresh air, and the daily routine of her home. At the same time, she was excited and hopeful about the new opportunities in Kathmandu, such as better education and a good job.</p>
            <p>However, Sita also faced challenges in the new place. She sometimes felt lonely and missed her old home a lot. It took time for her to adjust to the busy city life and new environment. Despite the difficulties, she believes that moving was necessary for her future and is now working hard to build a better life.</p>
            <p>In conclusion, leaving the old home was a mix of sadness and hope for Sita. It shows how migration brings both challenges and chances for growth.</p>
