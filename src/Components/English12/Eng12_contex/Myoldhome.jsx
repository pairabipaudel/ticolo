        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following question</p>
        <p>a. How does the narrator describe his feeling at the arrival of his old home?</p>
        <p>= When the narrator arrives at his old home, he experiences a mixture of emotions. Initially, he feels pleasure and happiness, recalling the lovely memories of his childhood when the sky was green and full of life. However, upon arrival, he is overwhelmed by a deep sense of depression and disappointment because the place has changed drastically. The vibrant green sky has turned into a vast, greying, and gloomy expanse, and the surroundings appear deserted and lifeless. There are no signs of progress or development, and the condition of his home is poor. This stark contrast between his nostalgic memories and the present reality fills him with sadness and a sense of loss.</p>
        <p>b. What were the three kinds of servants in China then? What does it indicate about contemporary Chinese society?</p>
        <p>=The three kinds of servants in China at that time were:

1. Dailies (Short-timers): These were day laborers who worked only for a day or a short period.

2. Yearlongs (Full-timers): Servants who worked for the same family throughout the year or longer.

3. Busy-mothers (Part-timers): Landowners who farmed their own land but worked for a particular family only during special occasions like New Year's festivals or when rent was due.

This division of servants indicates that contemporary Chinese society had a clear social hierarchy and an entrenched system of labor division. It reflects inequality and a form of servitude or slavery where people's work and status were strictly categorized based on their social and economic positions.</p>
        <p>c. What makes the narrator nostalgic? What did he do with Runtu in his teenage years?</p>
        <p>= The narrator becomes nostalgic when his mother asks him to meet his childhood friend Runtu, which brings back memories of their shared past. In their teenage years, the narrator and Runtu spent time together catching birds using tricks and hunting the Zha by stabbing it. They also collected colorful shells like reds, blues, and ghost-scarers. Additionally, they went out looking for animals such as badgers and porcupines. The respectful and formal way Runtu addressed the narrator as "Master" or "Brother Xun" also adds to the narrator's nostalgic feelings, reminding him of the close and respectful bond they shared during their youth.</p>
        <p>d. How did Runtu hunt a Zha at a young age?</p>
        <p>= At a young age, Runtu hunted a Zha by suddenly attacking it with a pointed knife or stabbing it with a pitchfork while he was standing guard over watermelons. Despite his efforts, the crafty Zha often made quick, lightning-fast turns, darting back between his legs to escape successfully.</p>
