        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The story “My Old Home” is about a man who returns to his hometown after living away for many years. He is around 30 years old and has been working in another city. Now, he comes back because his family is selling their old house. His mother and nephew are still living there, and they are preparing to move to another place where life might be easier.

When the narrator arrives, he looks around the house where he grew up. Everything feels different. The rooms seem smaller, and the yard is no longer filled with sunlight and joy. It feels darker, colder, and lifeless. He feels sad because the memories of his happy childhood don't match what he sees now. Time has changed everything.

He talks with his mother, who tells him that the old servant and his childhood friend Runtu will come to visit. Hearing Runtu's name brings back memories of when they were kids. Runtu was the son of a poor laborer and worked for the narrator's family. But even with the difference in class, they had been very close as children. They used to play together in the fields, collect shells, hunt for birds, and talk about everything.

The narrator remembers Runtu as cheerful and full of energy. But when Runtu finally arrives, he is not the same anymore. He looks older, tired, and burdened by a hard life. He has many children and struggles to feed his family. When they talk, it feels awkward. Runtu now sees the narrator as someone from a higher class, not as his friend. He speaks formally and calls him “Master,” showing the distance between them.

Runtu doesn't ask for anything directly, but the narrator's mother understands and gives him some old furniture and things they don't need. Runtu takes them gratefully. The narrator feels the pain of how time and society have changed their bond.

The narrator also spends time with his young nephew, Shuan, who is still innocent and full of life. He starts to hope that maybe the new generation like Shuan will grow up in a better world, where people are equal, where friendships are not broken by class or money, and where people can truly understand and support one another.

As the narrator leaves the old home for the last time, he looks back with mixed feelings, sadness for what is lost, but also a little hope for the future.

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following question</p>
        <p>a. How does the narrator describe his feeling at the arrival of his old home?</p>
        <p>= When the narrator arrives at his old home, he experiences a mixture of emotions. Initially, he feels pleasure and happiness, recalling the lovely memories of his childhood when the sky was green and full of life. However, upon arrival, he is overwhelmed by a deep sense of depression and disappointment because the place has changed drastically. The vibrant green sky has turned into a vast, greying, and gloomy expanse, and the surroundings appear deserted and lifeless. There are no signs of progress or development, and the condition of his home is poor. This stark contrast between his nostalgic memories and the present reality fills him with sadness and a sense of loss.</p>
        <p>b. What were the three kinds of servants in China then? What does it indicate about contemporary Chinese society?</p>
        <p>=The three kinds of servants in China at that time were:

1. Dailies (Short-timers): These were day laborers who worked only for a day or a short period.

2. Yearlongs (Full-timers): Servants who worked for the same family throughout the year or longer.

3. Busy-mothers (Part-timers): Landowners who farmed their own land but worked for a particular family only during special occasions like New Year's festivals or when rent was due.

This division of servants indicates that contemporary Chinese society had a clear social hierarchy and an entrenched system of labor division. It reflects inequality and a form of servitude or slavery where people's work and status were strictly categorized based on their social and economic positions.</p>
        <p>c. What makes the narrator nostalgic? What did he do with Runtu in his teenage years?</p>
        <p>= The narrator becomes nostalgic when his mother asks him to meet his childhood friend Runtu, which brings back memories of their shared past. In their teenage years, the narrator and Runtu spent time together catching birds using tricks and hunting the Zha by stabbing it. They also collected colorful shells like reds, blues, and ghost-scarers. Additionally, they went out looking for animals such as badgers and porcupines. The respectful and formal way Runtu addressed the narrator as "Master" or "Brother Xun" also adds to the narrator's nostalgic feelings, reminding him of the close and respectful bond they shared during their youth.</p>
        <p>d. How did Runtu hunt a Zha at a young age?</p>
        <p>= At a young age, Runtu hunted a Zha by suddenly attacking it with a pointed knife or stabbing it with a pitchfork while he was standing guard over watermelons. Despite his efforts, the crafty Zha often made quick, lightning-fast turns, darting back between his legs to escape successfully.</p>
