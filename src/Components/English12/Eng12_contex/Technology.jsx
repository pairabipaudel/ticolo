      <h3>Comprehension</h3>
      <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
      <p className='question'>a. What is a hyperloop? How does it work?</p>
      <p>= A hyperloop is a high-speed transport system where pods travel inside low-pressure tubes, reducing air resistance and friction. This lets them reach speeds up to 760 mph, making travel very fast and efficient.</p>
      <p className='question'>b. How is hyperloop more beneficial than the traditional trains?</p>
      <p>= Hyperloop is more beneficial than traditional trains because it is faster, cheaper, and more energy-efficient. Unlike traditional trains, hyperloop pods travel in low-pressure tubes that reduce friction, allowing higher speeds. It also uses less energy since the track doesn't constantly supply electricity.</p>
      <p className='question'>c. Does hyperloop have a successful history? How?</p>
      <p>= No, the hyperloop does not have a successful history yet. The original idea was based on using wagons and pneumatic tubes to transport mail and parcels between buildings, which was limited in scope. The modern hyperloop concept is still in development and has not yet been fully tested or widely used.</p>
      <p className='question'>d. Write the contributions of Robert Goddard and Elon Musk for the development of hyperloop.</p>
      <p>= Robert Goddard made an important early contribution to the development of the hyperloop with his "vactrain" concept in the early twentieth century. This idea involved using vacuum tubes to reduce air resistance and enable very high-speed travel, laying the foundation for future high-speed transportation concepts.
</p><p>
Decades later, Elon Musk, founder of SpaceX and Tesla, revived and popularized the hyperloop idea as a new mode of ultra-fast intercity transport. In August 2013, he released the "Hyperloop Alpha" paper, outlining a system of travel pods moving through steel tubes at high speeds. Musk envisioned the hyperloop as a “fifth mode” of transportation, alongside cars, planes, boats, and trains, reigniting interest and innovation in this advanced travel concept.</p>
      <p className='question'>e. What relation does speed have with air resistance? Explain</p>
      <p>= Speed and air resistance are connected because air resistance slows down moving objects. When there is more air resistance, the object moves slower. When there is less air resistance, the object can move faster. The Hyperloop travels through tubes with very little air, so there is almost no air resistance, allowing it to move at very high speeds.</p>
      <p className='question'>f. What are hyperloop capsule compared with? How are they similar?</p>
      <p>= Hyperloop capsules are compared with a Boeing 747 because both accelerate at similar rates. They are similar in that they both experience the same level of G-forces, making the ride comfortable for passengers.</p>
      <p className='question'>g. How do the passengers feel while travelling via hyperloop? What will be done to make it luxurious?</p>
      <p>= Passengers traveling via hyperloop feel similar to riding in an elevator or a passenger plane. To make the journey luxurious, the cabin will have beautiful views and each passenger will have access to their own entertainment system, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable trip.</p>
      <p className='question'>h. Why does the writer doubt about the success of hyperloop? What does the success depend on?</p>
      <p>= The writer doubts the success of the hyperloop because it requires a huge multibillion-dollar investment, and the projects are still in the early pilot and experimental stages. The success of the hyperloop depends on factors like the routes it serves, the stops it makes, and how strong the local economy is. Additionally, previous similar efforts by Nikola Tesla and Elon Musk were stopped due to a lack of support from government authorities.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Is the hyperloop the future of transportation or just a dream? What do you think? Justify your opinion with suitable reasons.</p>
        <p>= I believe the hyperloop is the future of transportation rather than just a dream. While it is still a concept in the experimental stage, it promises to revolutionize the way we travel by combining incredible speed with environmental friendliness.
</p><p>
The idea behind the hyperloop is simple yet advanced: passengers travel in pods that float and move inside low-pressure steel tubes at supersonic speeds. This drastically reduces air resistance and friction, allowing travel times between cities to be cut down by as much as 75%. It also aims to save about 90% of the energy used by conventional transport and reduce construction costs by around 50%, making it both cost-effective and sustainable.
</p><p>
The hyperloop concept is not entirely new; it is inspired by pneumatic tube systems that have been used for parcel and mail delivery since the 19th century. Just like flying was once considered impossible but is now common, the hyperloop could become a practical reality. Many innovative technologies started as dreams and then became everyday life.
</p><p>
Elon Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, introduced the modern hyperloop idea in 2013. His vision sparked worldwide interest, and several companies are now developing the technology with experimental tests already underway. Although it may take several years before hyperloop becomes widely available—some predict services could start around 2027—the potential benefits are enormous.
</p><p>
If successful, the hyperloop will not only make travel faster and more convenient but will also have a significant positive impact on the environment by reducing emissions. It will also boost economies by connecting cities more efficiently, saving people time and money.
</p><p>
In conclusion, while the hyperloop is still under development and not yet a reality, it holds great promise as the future of transportation. Its speed, sustainability, and cost advantages over current systems make it a highly likely candidate to transform how we travel in the coming decades. Just as airplanes changed travel forever, the hyperloop could do the same for ground transportation.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. The number of private vehicles is increasing day by day in Nepal beyond the capacity of our infrastructure. What do you think should be done to curb the ever-growing number private vehicles? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= The rapid increase in the number of private vehicles in Nepal is becoming a serious issue, as it is outpacing the country's infrastructure and creating multiple problems. While owning a private vehicle is often seen as a symbol of convenience and status, the growing number is causing severe traffic congestion, environmental pollution, and putting pressure on limited road infrastructure. To address this, several measures must be taken to control the rise of private vehicles and promote sustainable transportation.
</p><p>
First and foremost, discouraging people from buying and using private vehicles is essential. This can be done by imposing higher taxes on vehicle purchases and ownership, including progressive taxation where families owning multiple vehicles pay increasingly higher fees. Additionally, introducing or increasing tolls for private vehicles entering congested urban areas can reduce unnecessary trips and encourage people to consider alternative transport options.
</p><p>
However, taxation and tolls alone will not solve the problem unless public transportation is improved drastically. The current public transit system in Nepal is unreliable, overcrowded, and uncomfortable, discouraging many from using it. The government should invest in modernizing and expanding public transport by adding more buses, especially during peak hours, and upgrading vehicles to be cleaner, safer, and more comfortable. Ensuring punctuality and better maintenance of buses and stations will also help attract more passengers. Moreover, digitalizing public transport services for easier access, such as mobile apps for schedules and ticketing, would greatly improve user convenience.
</p><p>
Alongside infrastructure, changing public perception is crucial. There is a widespread belief that using public transport is inferior or undesirable. This stigma can be reduced by making public transit a dignified and pleasant experience. Cleanliness, safety, and amenities like air conditioning or entertainment can make buses more attractive. Promoting the environmental benefits of public transport and the negative impact of private vehicles on air quality will help raise awareness and encourage responsible behavior.
</p><p>
The government also needs to prioritize environmental regulations by penalizing vehicles that emit excessive pollution and promoting electric or hybrid vehicles. Encouraging the use of electric public buses and supporting eco-friendly transport options will contribute to reducing harmful emissions and protecting Nepal's environment.
</p><p>
In conclusion, curbing the ever-growing number of private vehicles in Nepal requires a multi-faceted approach. Imposing taxes and tolls, improving public transport quality, changing social attitudes, and focusing on environmental protection are all vital steps. With these measures, Nepal can reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and create a more sustainable transportation system that benefits all citizens.</p>
