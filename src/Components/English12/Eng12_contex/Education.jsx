        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'><strong>a.</strong> APJ Abdul Kalam became a renowned aerospace scientist in his later life. Do you find any association of his childhood days in shaping his career? Explain with specific instances from the text.</p>
        <p>= APJ Abdul Kalam's childhood had a strong influence on shaping his career as a renowned aerospace scientist. From a young age, he was deeply interested in mathematics and science, always scoring top marks and dedicating extra time to learning complex problems. A key moment that inspired him was a practical lesson given by his teacher, Sivasubramania Iyer, who took the students to the seashore to observe and explain how birds fly. This hands-on experience fascinated Kalam and sparked his curiosity about flight dynamics.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Kalam grew up in a loving and supportive family, which provided him with a secure environment to focus on his studies. Despite some social challenges like religious discrimination he witnessed, his passion for learning remained strong. His early dedication to understanding science and mathematics, combined with the inspiration from his teacher's practical demonstration of bird flight, motivated him to pursue aerospace engineering.</p>
        <p>Thus, there is a clear connection between Abdul Kalam's childhood experiences—his love for science and mathematics, the encouragement from his teachers, and the practical exposure to flight—and his later success as an aerospace scientist. These early influences helped him build the foundation for his future achievements in the field of aerospace.</p>

        <p className='question'><strong>b.</strong> Kalam mentions an instance of discrimination against him in his school life. What picture of society does he want to depict by mentioning the incident? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= Abdul Kalam's mention of the discrimination he faced in school reveals a sad and divided picture of society at that time. The incident where his new teacher forbade him, a Muslim boy, from sitting next to his Hindu friend, Ramanadhan Sastry, shows the deep religious divide between Hindus and Muslims. Despite their friendship, the teacher's narrow-mindedness reflected the prevalent social attitude of segregation and intolerance based on religion. Kalam's experience highlights how societal prejudices and communalism affected even innocent children, creating barriers between communities. By sharing this incident, Kalam wants to depict a society deeply divided by religious and caste differences, where discrimination was widespread and accepted by many, including educated individuals. This picture urges us to reflect on the harmful effects of such divisions and the need to overcome them for a more united and harmonious society.</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>Write a short autobiography featuring your childhood life using the following guidelines.</p>
        <p>Date and place of birth, Family background, Daily life, School life, Special event of childhood days, etc.</p>
        <p>= I was born in a peaceful town in Chitwan district. I come from a loving middle-class family of six. My father is a farmer who works hard every day to provide for us, and my mother takes care of our home with great warmth and care. I have two younger sisters who are still in school.</p>
        <p>Growing up in Chitwan was a wonderful experience. My days were filled with the sounds of birds, the green fields around our home, and the gentle breeze from the nearby forest. Every morning, I woke up early to help my parents with chores before going to school. My school was close to home, and I enjoyed walking there with my friends.</p>
        <p>School life was full of learning and fun. I loved my teachers, especially my science teacher who made classes interesting by explaining nature and animals around us. After school, I often played football or ran around with my friends in the open fields. Sometimes, we would explore the nearby riverbanks and watch elephants or deer from a distance.</p>
        <p>Besides outdoor games, I also enjoyed playing chess with my elder brother and friends. We would spend hours thinking carefully about each move, trying to outsmart each other. Playing chess helped me improve my focus and taught me the importance of patience and strategy.</p>
        <p>One of the most memorable events from my childhood was the annual Tharu cultural festival in our town. The whole community came together to celebrate with traditional music, dance, and food. I loved watching the colorful performances and joining in with the dances. It was a time when everyone forgot their worries and just enjoyed being together.</p>
        <p>My childhood in Chitwan was simple but full of love, nature, and happiness. It shaped who I am today and gave me memories that I will cherish forever.</p>
