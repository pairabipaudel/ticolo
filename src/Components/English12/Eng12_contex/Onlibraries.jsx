            <h3>Summary</h3>
            <p>Oliver Sacks begins the essay by sharing his childhood memories. He grew up in a home filled with books. His parents were both readers and encouraged him to explore books from a very young age. As a child, he loved to read science books, adventure stories, and anything he could get his hands on. He didn't just read for fun, reading became a way to understand the world around him.</p>
            <p>When he was a boy during World War II, he and his brother were sent away from London to the countryside for safety. There, books became his best friends. Since they were far from their parents and felt lonely, books gave them comfort and kept them company. The local library was like a magical place to him, it opened the doors to different worlds, ideas, and adventures.</p>
            <p>As he grew older, Sacks' love for libraries never faded. When he moved to New York, he was amazed by the richness of the New York Public Library. He spent hours and hours reading, researching, and simply being surrounded by books. Libraries, he says, are places not only to gather knowledge but also to find peace, inspiration, and connection with great thinkers of the past and present.</p>
            <p>Later in the essay, Sacks writes that libraries are essential for the development of a free and educated society. He believes they should be protected and preserved, especially in a time when the digital world is taking over. For him, a physical library is a sacred space, a treasure house of human knowledge, imagination, and memory.</p>

        <p>The author, Oliver Sacks, could be found in the oak-paneled library of his house, completely absorbed in reading a book whenever he was late for lunch or dinner.</p>
        <p>b. What are his first memories?</p>
        <p>= The author's first memories are of the large and beautiful oak-paneled library and the books in it. Since his parents, especially his mother, loved books, he was introduced to reading and the library from a very young age.</p>
        <p>c. Why did he dislike school?</p>
        <p>= He disliked school because he didn't like following teachers' instructions and passive learning. He preferred self-learning and exploring books freely in the library, where he could choose what interested him and gain knowledge on his own.</p>
        <p>d. What did he feel about at the library?</p>
        <p>= He felt free in the library because he could choose any book that interested him from thousands of books. The quiet and comfortable atmosphere allowed him to explore and enjoy reading. He also appreciated the silent companionship of other readers who shared the same love for books.</p>
        <p>e. Why was he so biased about sciences especially astronomy and chemistry?</p>
        <p>= He was biased about science especially astronomy and chemistry because of the two reasons - The first reason was that all the children used to dream of being astronauts and explore the space at that time. So he must have wished to know about it. The second reason was that he got older and he only needed those books which would support his studies.=To read all the books in the library is not possible and his study of interest was astronomy and chemistry. So, the author was biased about sciences especially astronomy and chemistry. =He was so biased about sciences especially astronomy and chemistry because of his growing interest in science.</p>
        <p>f. Why did he become so fascinated by Hook?</p>
        <p>= He became fascinated by Theodore Hook because Hook was admired in the 19th century for his wit and genius in theatrical and musical improvisation. Hook was famous for composing over 500 operas spontaneously, which amazed the author and sparked his interest.</p>
        <p>g. Describe library at the Queen's College.</p>
        <p>= The Queen's College is part of the University of Oxford, England. Its magnificent building, designed like a palace, was created by the famous architect Christopher Wren. Beneath the college are large underground rooms that serve as the library. The library has many bookshelves and heating pipes along the walls and corners. It features a classical design and houses original prints and editions of important works, ranging from Gesner to Darwin.</p>
        <p>h. Why did the students ignore the bookshelves in the 1990s?</p>
        <p>= In the 1990s, students ignored the bookshelves because they gained access to digitalized books through computers. With the rise of the internet and computerized resources, students found it easier and more convenient to read books electronically rather than visiting the library shelves.</p>
        <p>i. Why was he horrified when he visited the library a couple of months ago?</p>
        <p>= He was horrified when he visited the library a couple of months ago because most of the books had been removed from the shelves and replaced by digital versions. The once full shelves were now nearly empty, and many physical books had been thrown out. Since he didn't know how to use computers well, he felt deeply saddened by the loss of centuries of knowledge stored in those books.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. The author says, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.” Justify it with the textual evidences.</p>
        <p>= Oliver Sacks says, “I was not a good pupil, but I was a good listener.” This means that although he did not perform well in the usual school activities like doing exercises or submitting assignments, he paid attention quietly in class. He often found the teachers' lectures boring and felt that the information went “in one ear and out the other.” He was not interested in passive learning inside the classroom.
</p><p>
However, Sacks was a keen learner in his own way. He spent most of his time in the library where he freely chose books to read and explore topics deeply. He compared what he heard in class with what he read in books, made notes, and absorbed knowledge actively. His listening was not just hearing words in class but also listening to knowledge from books. This self-directed learning made him a good learner despite not being a good traditional pupil.
</p><p>
Thus, the phrase shows his preference for independent, active learning over passive classroom education.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. A proverb says, “Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library.” Does this proverb apply in the essay? Explain.</p>
        <p>Yes, the proverb “Nothing is pleasanter than exploring a library” perfectly applies to the essay On Libraries by Oliver Sacks.
</p><p>
In the essay, Sacks beautifully describes how libraries shaped his life. From an early age, his favorite place was the oak-paneled library at home, where he would often get lost in books, even forgetting to eat. He preferred the freedom and joy of discovering books on his own rather than passively listening in school. He didn't enjoy classroom learning but found deep satisfaction in roaming through library shelves, choosing books of interest, and immersing himself in reading.
</p><p>
He even describes the companionship of other quiet readers in the library as comforting and inspiring. This deep emotional connection to libraries and the pleasure he found in exploring them proves that for him—and many like him—nothing was more pleasant than being surrounded by books.
</p><p>
Thus, the proverb truly reflects the essence of the essay.</p>

            <p>c. Are there any other services that you would like to see added to the library?</p>
            <p>= Yes, I would like to see some additional services added to libraries. For example, separate reading rooms for different age groups such as children, adults, and senior citizens would help readers find books that suit their interests and age. Children might enjoy stories and comics, adults might prefer topics like environment and culture, while seniors might like books on politics, philosophy, or ethics.
</p><p>
Also, installing surveillance cameras would help protect books from damage or theft, ensuring that all readers can enjoy the materials safely. Comfortable furniture is important too because sitting for long hours can be tiring, so having a small garden or relaxing space nearby would help readers refresh themselves.
</p><p>
Finally, a café inside the library would be a great addition, allowing readers to enjoy snacks and drinks during long reading sessions.
</p><p>
These services would make the library more welcoming and useful for everyone.</p>

            <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
            <p className='question'>a. Write an essay on Libraries and its uses for students.
Libraries and its Uses for Students</p>
            <p>= A library is a place where books and other sources of information are stored and made accessible to people. It serves as an important resource for students and learners of all ages. Libraries contain a wide variety of materials such as books, magazines, newspapers, DVDs, and manuscripts, making them a comprehensive source of knowledge and information.
</p><p>
Libraries play a vital role in the academic life of students. They provide reliable and diverse content that encourages learning and the development of reading habits. Students can find reference materials, textbooks, and research papers that help them complete their homework and projects effectively. For book lovers, libraries are a treasure trove where they can read as much as they want and explore new subjects. The variety of books ensures that students of different interests and fields can find what they need.
</p><p>
Another great advantage of libraries is their economical nature. Not every student can afford to buy all the books they need, especially expensive textbooks. Libraries allow students to borrow books free of cost, saving money while still gaining access to important resources. This makes education more accessible and inclusive.
</p><p>
Moreover, libraries provide a quiet and peaceful environment that helps students concentrate better on their studies. The atmosphere of a library, with other readers around, encourages discipline and focus. Many libraries also provide digital resources like e-books, audiobooks, and internet access, making it easier for students to explore knowledge in modern ways.
</p><p>
In my own community, we have a public library named Bhanubhakta Memorial Library. It is a popular place among students and people of all ages. The library offers a wide range of books and also free internet access, which helps users to access online resources. For me, the library is not only a place to study but also a place to meet people with similar interests and learn from them.
</p><p>
In conclusion, libraries are invaluable for students and the community as a whole. They promote learning, provide access to information, and support personal and academic growth. Even in today's digital age, the importance of libraries cannot be ignored. We must continue to use and support libraries to keep the spirit of learning alive.</p>

            <p className='question'>b. Do you have any public library in your locality? If so, do the people in your community use it? Give a couple of examples.</p>
            <p>= Yes, we have a public library in my neighborhood. It is called Bhanubhakta Memorial Library. Many people from our community go there to read books and study. My friends and I also like to visit the library because it has many interesting books and a quiet place to read.
</p><p>
For example, last week my cousin went to the library to find books for his school project. He was very happy because he found all the books he needed. Also, my neighbor goes to the library almost every day to read newspapers and magazines. The library helps everyone learn and have fun with books. I think it is a very important place for our community.</p>
