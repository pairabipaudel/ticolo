        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The Bull by Bhimnidhi Tiwari is a satirical play that tells the story of a bull named Male owned by King Rana Bahadur Shah in late 18th-century Nepal. The play begins when Gore and Jitman, the cowherds, discover that Male has died. They are very afraid because the king is known for his bad temper, and they worry about the consequences of the bull's death.</p>
        <p>The cowherds quickly inform Laxminarayan, a royal official and the bull's caretaker. Instead of telling the king the truth, Laxminarayan decides to hide the bull's death. When the king comes to see Male, Laxminarayan runs ahead and orders the cowherds to massage the bull's legs and wave fans to make it look like the bull is still alive and being cared for.</p>
        <p>Despite their efforts, the king soon realizes the bull is dead. He declares Male's death, and Gore and Jitman cry loudly, pretending to be very sad to avoid the king's punishment. The play highlights the absurdity and cruelty of the feudal system, where the king's property, even an animal, is more important than the lives of common people.</p>
        <p>Through humor and irony, the play shows how people live in fear, forced to flatter and lie to protect themselves from harsh rulers. It also reveals the unfairness and injustice of a society where power belongs only to the king and his officials, while ordinary people suffer.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. Why have Gore and Jitman come to see Laxminarayan?</p>
        <p>= Gore and Jitman have come to see Laxminarayan to inform him about the death of King Ranabahadur's bull.</p>
        <p>b. What, according to cowherds, is the reason behind the death of Male?</p>
        <p>= According to the cowherds, Male died because he was fed a heavy diet of fine rice and split red gram soup, which he could not properly digest.</p>
        <p>c. Why does Ranabahadur want to see the bull himself?</p>
        <p>= Ranabahadur wants to see the bull himself to examine its condition and decide if it can be treated at Gauchar, Kathmandu. If the bull improves after treatment there, it will not have to be taken to the hills.</p>
        <p>d. Why does Laxminarayan run ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar?</p>
        <p>= Laxminarayan runs ahead of the convoy at Thulo Gauchar to instruct the cowherds to massage the bull's back feet and wave fans at it. He does this to create an impression for King Ranabahadur Shah that the bull is being well cared for. If the king finds out otherwise, he would become angry and punish them.</p>
        <p>e. Why do Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead?</p>
        <p>= Gore and Jitman cry when the king declares that Male is dead to display their fake sympathy and concern for the bull. Their dramatic weeping is an attempt to win the king's forgiveness and avoid punishment. Knowing the king's unpredictable temper, they fear he might hold them responsible for the bull's death and punish them severely.</p>
        <p>f. How do we learn that the bull is dead?</p>
        <p>= We learn that the bull is dead through both physical signs and the statements of the characters. The cowherds, Laxminarayan, and the king all suggest the bull's death through their dialogues. Physically, the bull shows no signs of life—his breathing has stopped, his tail has gone limp, his ears have dropped backward, and he is unable to eat. These clear indicators confirm that the bull is no longer alive.</p>
        <p>g. How does the play make a satire on the feudal system?</p>
        <p>= The play The Bull by Bhimnidhi Tiwari satirizes the feudal system by exposing the cruelty, domination, and dehumanization faced by ordinary people under feudal rule. It highlights how the lives of common people were considered less valuable than that of animals owned by the rulers. In the play, the king's bull receives more care, attention, and respect than the human workers. The cowherds live in constant fear, hiding the truth about the bull's death to avoid punishment.

The play mocks the absurdity of such a system, where people are reduced to living at the mercy of their feudal lord. It reveals how fear and oppression force individuals to act dishonestly just to survive. Through this, the drama powerfully critiques the inhumanity and injustice of the feudal structure.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the Context</h3>
        <p>a. Discuss the late eighteenth-century Nepali society as portrayed in terms of the relation between the king and his subjects as portrayed in the play.</p>
        <p>= The play The Bull by Bhimnidhi Tiwari portrays the late eighteenth-century Nepali society under the Shah monarchy, highlighting the absolute power of the king and the fear-driven lives of his subjects. During this period, the king had complete control over his people, and subjects had to obey every command without question. Any disobedience or mistake could lead to severe punishment, even death.

In the play, the fear of King Rana Bahadur Shah is evident when the bull dies, and the cowherds, along with Laxminarayan, panic. They pretend the bull is still alive to avoid the king's wrath. Their behavior reflects how people were forced to act submissively, hiding the truth to protect themselves from punishment. This shows that people valued their safety over honesty due to the oppressive rule.

The play also reflects the male-dominated structure of society at that time. Laxminarayan having seven wives indicates the prevalence of polygamy and the social acceptance of patriarchy. Overall, the play satirizes a feudal society where kings were treated like gods, common people lived in fear, and their lives were controlled by those in power.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. What does the relation between Laxminarayan and his wives tell us about the society of that time? To what extent has the Nepali society changed since then?</p>
        <p>= The relationship between Laxminarayan and his wives reflects the deeply rooted patriarchal structure of eighteenth-century Nepali society. Laxminarayan, a legal officer and the king's bull doctor, has seven wives and is still planning to marry an eighth. He casually refers to his wives using different nicknames, which shows a lack of respect and individuality for each of them. This practice of polygamy and the treatment of women as property or status symbols highlights the dominance of men during that time.

Women had very limited rights and lived under the control of their husbands. They were largely illiterate, deprived of political and financial awareness, and had no say in important decisions, including marriage. Practices like child marriage were common, and women were expected to remain obedient and silent in all matters.

In contrast, modern Nepali society has seen significant transformation. Women's literacy rates have improved greatly, and their participation in politics, education, and the workforce has increased. Legal reforms and awareness campaigns have helped eliminate many harmful practices like child marriage and dowry. Gender equality is now promoted through various laws and organizations working for women's rights and empowerment. Although challenges still remain, Nepal has made commendable progress in moving toward a more equal and just society.</p>

      <div>
        <p>c. Shed light on the practice of chakari as portrayed in the play. Have you noticed this practice in your society?</p>
        <p>= The practice of chakari the act of flattering or serving someone in power to gain personal favor was deeply ingrained in Nepali society during the monarchical era. It was especially common among those who sought wealth, promotion, or protection. People engaged in chakari to please their rulers, often out of fear of punishment or in hope of personal gain. Failure to perform this flattery properly could lead to serious consequences.

In the play The Bull by Bhimnidhi Tiwari, chakari is portrayed vividly through the behavior of characters like Laxminarayan and the cowherds, Gore and Jitman. These characters go to great lengths to show excessive respect and devotion to King Ranabahadur Shah. For example, even after the royal bull is dead, they pretend it is alive to avoid the king's wrath. Laxminarayan rushes ahead to instruct the cowherds to massage the bull's legs and wave fans, calling it “Bull Sir,” to maintain the illusion of care and loyalty.

This exaggerated obedience highlights the fear-driven loyalty of subjects toward rulers. The play satirically reflects how chakari was used not out of genuine respect, but as a survival tactic in a feudal system where the king's will was absolute.

In today's context, although Nepal is no longer a monarchy, traces of chakari still exist, especially in politics and bureaucracy. People often try to gain favor from those in power through flattery or influence rather than merit. While the intensity may have lessened, the underlying mentality persists in certain sectors of society.</p>

      <div>
        <p>d. How does Laxminarayan outsmart Rana Bahadur?</p>
        <p>Laxminarayan outsmarts King Rana Bahadur Shah through clever manipulation and flattery. As a legal officer and the doctor of the king's bull, he is informed by Gore and Jitman about the bull's death. Realizing the king's unpredictable temper, he wisely chooses not to disclose the truth immediately. Instead, he tells the king that the bull is sick and needs treatment.

Laxminarayan rushes ahead to instruct the cowherds to pretend the bull is still alive, massaging its legs and waving fans at it. This staged care gives the impression that the bull received proper treatment before its death. When the king finally sees the bull and declares it dead, Laxminarayan and the cowherds act surprised and mournful, winning the king's sympathy.

Through this trickery, Laxminarayan successfully avoids the king's wrath and protects himself and the cowherds from punishment. His quick thinking and ability to manipulate the king's emotions highlight how he outwits Rana Bahadur.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>e. Sketch the character of Laxminarayan.</p>
        <p>= Laxminarayan Dahal is the central character of Bhimnidhi Tiwari's one-act play The Bull. He is a forty-year-old legal officer and the personal doctor of King Rana Bahadur Shah's bull. He holds a respectable position in the royal court but lives a complex personal life, being married to seven wives and still expressing dissatisfaction, as he plans to marry an eighth.

Laxminarayan is portrayed as an intelligent, cunning, and quick-witted man. When he learns of the bull's death, instead of informing the king directly, he uses his cleverness to manage the situation. Aware of the king's volatile temperament, he presents the news as if the bull is still alive but sick. He instructs the cowherds to pretend to care for the bull in front of the king, massaging its legs and waving fans, creating an illusion of dedicated service. This tactful deception saves him and the cowherds from possible punishment.

Although Laxminarayan is skilled at handling high-pressure situations and understands the intricacies of royal service and chakari (flattery), his personal life reveals flaws. His polygamous lifestyle reflects the patriarchal norms of his time, and he appears emotionally disconnected from his wives. Additionally, he mentions having many enemies, suggesting he is not well-liked socially, possibly due to his manipulative nature.

Overall, Laxminarayan is a complex character, sharp, strategic, and loyal to survival, but also a product of a deeply hierarchical and patriarchal society.</p>

        <p>a. Write an essay in about 300 words on "The Nepali Society: Past, Present, and Future."</p>
        <p>= The Nepali Society: Past, Present, and Future
           Nepali society has changed a lot over time. In the past, people lived under the rule of kings. There were many strict rules, and only a few people had power. Common people didn't have many rights. Most women were not allowed to go to school or work. People followed old traditions like child marriage and caste discrimination. Life was hard for many, and people feared their rulers.

Today, things are much better. Nepal is now a democratic country where people can choose their leaders through voting. Boys and girls both go to school. Women can now work, become leaders, and speak for their rights. People are more aware of equality, and the use of technology like mobile phones and the internet has connected people even in remote villages. We now have hospitals, better roads, and more job opportunities. However, problems like corruption, unemployment, and poverty still exist.

In the future, Nepali society has great hope. If we all work hard, respect each other, and use education and technology wisely, we can build a better country. We need to protect our environment, treat everyone equally, and stop old harmful practices. Young people can play a big role by learning well and helping their community.

In conclusion, Nepali society has grown from a strict and unfair past to a more open and modern present. If we keep moving forward with kindness, education, and honesty, the future of Nepal will be bright and full of opportunity.
