        <p>C. Complete the following text with correct prepositions.</p>
        <p>What are we seeing here? One very real possibility is that these are the educational consequences of the differences <strong>in</strong> parenting styles that we talked about <strong>in</strong> the Chris Langan chapter. Think back to Alex Williams, the nine-year-old whom Annette Lareau studied. His parents believe <strong>in</strong> connected cultivation. He gets taken <strong>to</strong> museums and gets enrolled <strong>in</strong> special programs and goes <strong>to</strong> summer camp, where he takes classes. When he's bored <strong>at</strong> home, there are plenty of books to read, and his parents see it as their responsibility to keep him actively engaged <strong>in</strong>the world <strong>for</strong> him. It's hard to see how Alex would get better <strong>at</strong> reading and math <strong>in</strong> the summer.</p>
