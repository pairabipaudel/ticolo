<div>
    <p className='question'>B. Answer the following questions.</p>
    <p className='question'>a. Who was Julia Butterfly Hill? How did Hill's campaign gain popularity?</p>
    <p>= Julia Butter Jill was a person who lived in a 200-ft-tall redwood tree for more than two years to draw attention to the continued clearcutting of California's remaining redwood forests. Her campaign gained popularity when she started to have occasional visitors.
</p>
    <p className='question'>b. What made Hill start her mega campaign to save redwood trees?</p>
    <p>= When she arrived in the redwood forest, she was gripped by the spirit of the forest. She dropped to her knees and began to sob seeing the clearcutting of redwood trees. She sat and cried for a long time and finally decided to start her mega campaign to save redwood trees.</p>

    <p className='question'>c. What kinds of amenities were there to support Hill's life in the tree?</p>
    <p>= Hill had a sleeping bag, a solar-powered cell phone for media interviews, and a single-burner propane stove to cook and heat water to support her life in the tree. She had few necessities, and no luxuries.</p>

    <p className='question'>d. Did Hill's value of life change after her car accident? How?</p>
    <p>= Yes, Hill's value of life changed after her car accident. She said the experience was a wake-up call. Before accident her main focus had been work but later on she became clear that value as people is not in their stock portfolios and bank accounts, but it is in the legacies they leave behind.</p>

    <p className='question'>e. Deforestation causes natural calamities. What evidence do you have in the text to prove this?</p>
    <p>= Yes it's true that deforestation causes natural calamities. In the text we can see that the cutting of redwoods destabilized the hillside and caused the mudslide which carried trees, stumps and debris from that hillside down into the town, leaving seven families without homes.</p>

    <p className='question'>f. How did the logging company try to discourage Hill in the early days of her sit-in ?</p>
    <p>= The logging company tried to discourage Hill in the early days of her sit-in by hiring 24-hour security guards to harass her and to ensure her support team couldn't deliver her supplies. She was menaced with a helicopter at a dangerously close range. A neighboring tree was felled, hitting Luna's outer branches and nearly causing Hill to fall. She was verbally abused, threatened with violence, rape and death, kept awake with floodlights, and bugles and air horns were blown through the night.</p>

    <p className='question'>g. How were the vagaries of nature unwelcoming to Hill?</p>
    <p>= The logging company wasn't her only problem. One of her scariest times was a 16-hour, 70-mph windstorm that shredded the tarps that surrounded her, and even ripped huge branches off the tree. When lightning struck nearby during an electrical storm, her hair stood straight up. In this way the vagaries of nature were unwelcoming to Hill.</p>

    <p className='question'>h. What is the purpose of the author to write a review on Hill's book? Do you think the author stands for ecological sustainability? Give reasons.</p>
    <p>= The purpose of the author to write a review on Hill's book is to bring a spotlight to the issue of deforestation. He wants people to learn about the deforestation and its ill effects through his review and make people know about what a person should do to prevent from this should. Yes I think the author stands for ecological sustainability.</p>

    <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
    <p className='question'> Suppose you are Julia Butterfly Hill. After staying one year in the tree, the government offered you five million dollars and requested you to drop the strike. Write in about 200 words responding them that the money is a mean thing for you in comparison with the woods.</p>
    <p>Dear Representatives,</p>
    <p>I deeply appreciate your offer, but I must respectfully decline.</p>
    <p>Living in this tree for the past year has been more than a protest—it has become a spiritual journey and a responsibility I cannot ignore. The redwoods are not just trees; they are ancient beings, protectors of ecosystems, and symbols of life's balance. Their roots hold the earth together, their branches give shelter to countless species, and their very presence reminds us of what true wisdom and endurance look like.</p>
    <p>Offering me five million dollars to walk away might seem generous, but it reveals how disconnected we have become from what truly matters. Money cannot replace a living tree, a thriving forest, or a stable ecosystem. Once these giants are gone, no amount of wealth can bring them back.</p>
    <p>My purpose here is not for fame, wealth, or comfort, but to speak on behalf of those who cannot speak—the trees, the animals, and the future generations who will inherit this planet. I am not sitting in this tree because I want something. I am here because I have something to give.</p>
    <p>And that something—my voice, my time, my dedication—is not for sale.</p>
    <p>Sincerely,</p>
    <p>Julia Butterfly Hill</p>

    <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>A. Write a review of a book/flim which you have read/watched recently.</p>
        <h5>Seto Dharti</h5>
        <p>Title of the Book: Seto Dharti</p><p>
Author of the Book: Amar Neupane</p><p>
Country: Nepal</p><p>
Language: Nepali</p><p>
First Originally Published by: FinePrint Publication in 2012</p><p>
Genre: Historical Fiction / Social Realism</p><p>
Cost of the Book: Rs. 450</p><p>
Name of the Publisher: FinePrint Publication</p><p>
Edition and Year of Copyright: First Edition, 2012</p><p>
No. of Pages: 288</p><p>
Writing Style: Descriptive and Reflective Narrative</p><p>
Characters: Tara (main character), her parents, village elders, priests</p><p>

Plot:</p><p>
Seto Dharti tells the tragic life story of Tara, a girl who is married off at a very young age and becomes a widow before she even understands what marriage is. The novel traces her emotional and physical journey from childhood to old age. After losing her husband, she is forced to live a life of loneliness and suppression in a conservative society that sees widowhood as a curse. Despite her vibrant personality and desire to live freely, society slowly strips her of color, joy, and choice—leaving her on the metaphorical “white earth.”</p><p>

Summary:</p><p>
The novel explores themes such as child marriage, the condition of women in rural Nepal, and the cruelty of social customs. It spans Tara's entire life, from a cheerful girl to a wise old woman, as she adapts to the life society forces upon her. Along the way, we see not just her personal pain, but also a portrait of traditional Nepali society where outdated customs dictate a woman's fate.</p><p>

My Impressions:</p><p>
Seto Dharti is a heartbreaking and powerful novel that makes the reader reflect on how deeply rooted traditions can destroy lives. Amar Neupane's writing is lyrical and full of emotion. Tara's story is quiet, but unforgettable. It made me feel the pain of millions of women who never got to live life on their own terms. The use of “white” (seto) as a symbol of widowhood, emptiness, and purity is beautifully woven throughout the story. This book is not just literatur it's a voice for the voiceless. Highly recommended.

       <p className='question'>B. Your school is going to organize a speech competition on coming Friday. The subject of the speech is "Let's save the trees and protect over environment." Draft a speech using the following prompts.</p>
     <h5>Let's Save the Trees and Protect Our Environment</h5><p>

Good morning everyone,</p><p>
Thank you for giving me the chance to speak on this important topic — Let's Save the Trees and Protect Our Environment.</p><p>

Air is the most important thing we need to live. Trees give us clean air. They take in carbon dioxide and give out oxygen, which we need to breathe. That is why trees are often called the lungs of our planet.</p><p>

But sadly, people are cutting down trees to build buildings and roads. This is called deforestation. It harms nature and makes the planet suffer. When we cut down trees, we get more pollution, hotter temperatures (global warming), animals lose their homes, and the soil becomes weak.</p><p>

If we keep cutting trees like this, future generations will not have clean air or a healthy planet to live on. So, we must plant more trees — this is called afforestation. Planting trees helps save the Earth.</p><p>

Even one tree can make a difference. If we all do our part and plant more trees, we can protect the environment and leave behind a greener, better planet for our children.</p><p>

Let's all remember: Save Trees, Save Lives, Save Earth!</p><p>
Thank you for listening.</p>
