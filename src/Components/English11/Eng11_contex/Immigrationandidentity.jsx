        <h3>Comprehension</h3>

        <p className='question'>a. How is Willie Chandran different from the rest of his family?</p>
        <p>= Willie Chandran is different from his family because he feels unsure about himself and his identity. He doesn't feel confident like others around him.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Who is the main character of Half A Life? How is he described?</p>
        <p>= Willie Chandran is the main character. He was born in India about 40 years ago. His father is a Brahmin and his mother is poor. His middle name comes from the English writer Somerset Maugham.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why does Willie leave India?</p>
        <p>= Willie leaves India because he doesn't have a clear identity there. Being the son of a high caste father and a low caste mother makes his life difficult. He feels hatred for his father and wins a scholarship to study in London.</p>

        <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What kind of divided identity is depicted in the novel 'Half a Life'? How do characters in the novel try to create new identities for themselves? Explain.</p>
        <p>= The novel Half a Life shows how some people struggle with having a divided or mixed identity. The story mainly focuses on three characters: Willie, Ana, and a man with big light eyes. Willie, who is the main character, has a divided identity because his father is a high-caste Brahmin and his mother is from a lower caste. In India, this causes him to feel insecure and confused about who he really is. He doesn't feel comfortable in India because of discrimination based on caste. So, he decides to move to London to find freedom and create a new identity for himself.
</p><p>
Ana is another character with a mixed identity. She is part Portuguese and part African. Like Willie, she also struggles to find where she belongs. When Ana comes to London, she tries to figure out her own identity. Later, she goes back to her country, which is a Portuguese-African colony, hoping to have a higher status thereâ€”even if it means pretending to be someone else to hide her true past.
</p><p>
Willie follows Ana to her country hoping he will be accepted there, but he also feels lost. He sees how some people, like an illegitimate man born to an African mother and Portuguese father, suffer because of their background. These people are treated badly by others just because of their birth. This shows how hard it is for people with mixed or divided identities to find their place in the world.
</p><p>
In short, the novel Half a Life shows the struggles of people trying to find themselves when their identity is divided by race, culture, or history. They try to make new identities by moving to new places or acting differently, but it's not always easy to feel fully accepted.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Discuss the similaries between the author and the protagonist in the noivel?</p>
        <p>= There are many things in common between the writer V.S. Naipaul and the main character Willie Chandran from the novel Half a Life. Both of them were born in countries where they felt like they didn't fully belong. Naipaul was born in Trinidad, but his family came from India. Willie was born in India, but he always felt uncomfortable because his parents were from different castes. This made him feel like he didn't have a clear identity.
</p><p>
Like Willie, Naipaul also left his home at a young age to study in England. They both got scholarships and spent several years there. During their time in England, they both became interested in writing. Willie wrote a book while studying in London, and Naipaul also became a writer and wrote many books throughout his life.
</p><p>
Another similarity is that both Naipaul and Willie lived far from their home countries. They experienced life in new places and had to deal with feelings of confusion and not fully fitting in. It seems like the author used his own experiences to create the character of Willie. Because of that, the story feels more real and relatable. Naipaul probably understood how Willie felt because he had gone through similar things himself.</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>B. Write a review of a book/film you have recently read or watched.</p>
        <p>Book Review: Seto Dharti</p><p>
Author: Amar Neupane</p><p>
Published Date: 2012</p><p>
Genre: Historical Fiction / Social Realism</p><p>
Number of Pages: Around 356 pages</p><p>
Language: Nepali</p><p>

Seto Dharti is a powerful and emotional Nepali novel written by Amar Neupane. It tells the heartbreaking story of a girl named Tara, who becomes a widow at a very young age and has to live her entire life under the strict rules of society. The book is set in old Nepalese society, where child marriage and widowhood were very common and painful for girls.
</p><p>
Tara's journey starts with innocence and ends in silence and loneliness. Even though she loses her childhood, her husband, and freedom, she never complains or becomes bitter. This makes her a very strong and inspiring character.
</p><p>
The novel uses simple and beautiful language, which makes it easy to understand and emotional to read. The descriptions are so good that you can imagine the village life, customs, and struggles clearly in your mind.
</p><p>
Seto Dharti teaches us about the unfair traditions that existed in our society, especially for women. It encourages us to think about change and treat everyone with respect and love.
</p><p>
I recommend this book to anyone who enjoys meaningful and touching stories. It's not just a story about one girl, it's a story of many girls who suffered silently.</p>
