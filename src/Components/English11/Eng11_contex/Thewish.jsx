        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>“The Wish” is a short story about a young boy who uses his vivid imagination to turn an ordinary moment into an exciting and suspenseful adventure. The story begins with the boy picking a scab off his knee and flicking it across the hallway, where it lands on a carpet patterned with red, black, and yellow sections.

The boy imagines that the red parts of the carpet are burning coals and the black parts are filled with poisonous snakes, while the yellow parts are the only safe areas to step on. He makes up a rule in his mind: if he can walk from one end of the carpet to the other by stepping only on the yellow parts avoiding the “coals” and “snakes” he will be rewarded with a puppy. Taking this imaginary game very seriously, he carefully balances each step, feeling the intensity and danger of his challenge.

As he nears the end of the carpet, the boy loses his balance and accidentally touches the black “snake.” He cries out, and the story ends with his mother searching for him behind the house, leaving the reader uncertain whether this was a simple game of imagination or if the boy was actually crossing a dangerous swamp, as some interpretations suggest.

The story highlights the incredible power of a child's imagination to transform ordinary things into thrilling adventures. It also explores themes of self-confidence and overcoming fear, as the boy bravely faces his challenge. Although he knows the reward of a puppy is imaginary, his determination to complete the task shows his desire to conquer difficulties and prove his courage.

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. What did the child do to the scab on his knee?</p>
        <p>= The child carefully noticed a scab that had formed on his knee from a recent cut. Using his fingernails, he gently picked at the scab, slowly loosening it from his skin. After successfully removing the scab, he placed it on his thigh for a moment, as if examining it. Then, with a quick flick of his finger, he threw the scab away, sending it flying across the room and onto the carpet in the hallway. This simple action sets the scene for the imaginative journey that follows in the story.</p>
        <p>b. What kind of effect did the carpet have on the child?</p>
        <p>= The child was deeply amazed when he looked at the carpet. Although he had seen it many times before, he had never truly noticed its colors and patterns until that moment. The bright red, black, and yellow colors seemed to glow and come alive, almost as if they were sparkling and moving on their own. The carpet's vibrant patterns captured his full attention and sparked his imagination. He became completely absorbed, seeing the carpet not just as a floor covering, but as something magical and exciting that inspired him to create an adventurous game in his mind.</p>
        <p>c. What was he afraid of while walking across the carpet?</p>
        <p>= While walking across the carpet, the child was afraid of stepping on the black and red parts. In his imagination, the black sections were dangerous poisonous snakes that could bite him if he touched them. The red parts, on the other hand, were like burning coals that could burn his feet. Because of these imagined dangers, he was very careful and cautious with every step, trying hard to avoid stepping on anything unsafe while making his way across the carpet.</p>
        <p>d. What motivated and encouraged the child to start and continue on his journey?</p>
        <p>= The child was motivated and encouraged to begin and keep going on his journey across the carpet by his strong wish to receive a puppy as a birthday gift. In his imagination, he believed that if he successfully crossed the carpet by stepping only on the safe yellow parts and avoided the “dangerous” red coals and black snakes, he would be rewarded with a puppy. This hope gave him the courage and determination to carefully navigate the carpet, despite the imagined dangers. His desire for the puppy pushed him to face the challenge bravely and to keep going until the very end.</p>
        <p>e. What did the child see as he looked down on the black patterns of the carpet?</p>
        <p>= As the child looked down at the black patterns on the carpet, he noticed the colors shining and brightening in a mysterious way. He became completely absorbed and lost in the different spots and shapes of color. His imagination started to turn the black patterns into something much more vivid and frightening. He imagined the black spots as poisonous snakes with shiny, oily bodies that could suddenly rise up and bite him. This vivid mental image made the carpet feel alive and dangerous, which added excitement and fear to his imaginary game as he carefully tried to avoid touching the “snakes.”</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. The writer creates two voices in the story. Who are they?</p>
        <p>= Yes, the writer creates two distinct voices in the story. The first is the narrator's voice, which describes the events and provides an outside perspective. The second is the voice of the young boy, who expresses his thoughts, feelings, and imagination as he experiences the carpet adventure. These two voices work together to bring the story to life, showing both the real world and the child's imaginative inner world.</p>

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>c. Which images and metaphors are used in the story?</p>
        <p>= In Roald Dahl's story “The Wish,” the journey of the young boy across the carpet is a powerful metaphor for the challenges and obstacles that people face as they grow up and try to achieve their goals. The carpet is not just a floor covering but represents the difficult path of life, filled with dangers and uncertainties that must be carefully navigated.

Several vivid images throughout the story support this metaphor and make the boy's imaginative journey feel real and suspenseful. One of the first images is the scab on the boy's knee, which symbolizes his initial injury or hardship. This small wound becomes the starting point for his imaginative game, showing how even small problems can feel very important or scary to a child.

The colors of the carpet themselves are full of meaning. The red parts of the carpet are imagined as burning lumps of coal, which represent pain, danger, and the threat of getting hurt. The boy fears stepping on these red “coals” because they could burn his feet, symbolizing the painful experiences that can happen in life. The black sections of the carpet take on an even more frightening image in his mind: they become poisonous snakes with oily bodies that can bite and cause harm. These snakes symbolize the hidden dangers and fears we often imagine in difficult situations.

The yellow parts of the carpet, in contrast, are seen as the only safe spots to step on. They symbolize hope, safety, and the right choices that help a person succeed and avoid harm. The boy's careful steps across these yellow parts show his determination to overcome fear and face his challenges bravely.

Together, these images and metaphors create a vivid picture of a child's imagination turning an ordinary object into a dramatic and meaningful journey. The story reminds us how children use imagination to cope with fears and how life's challenges can seem both scary and exciting.</p>

        <p>e. The story shows the events through the eyes of the narrator and the child. Comparing the two styles, who presents a more interesting or effective view for the readers? Why?</p>
        <p>= In “The Wish,” the story is told through both the narrator's voice and the child's point of view. While the narrator provides the overall setting and describes the events clearly, it is the child's perspective that presents a more interesting and effective view for the readers. This is because the child's imagination brings the story to life with vivid and suspenseful details.

Through the child's eyes, ordinary things like the carpet become part of an exciting and dangerous adventure filled with “burning coals” and “poisonous snakes.” The child faces his fears and challenges with courage, motivated by the hope of receiving a puppy as a birthday gift. This imaginative and emotional experience draws readers in and helps them feel what the child feels his excitement, fear, and determination.

Overall, the child's viewpoint makes the story more engaging because it turns a simple moment into a meaningful journey, showing how powerful and creative a child's mind can be.</p>

      <div>
        <p>f. Is “The Wish” a story about self-confidence overcoming fear or about greed? Give your arguments.</p>
        <p>= Roald Dahl's “The Wish” is mainly about self-confidence overcoming fear rather than greed. While it is true that the boy's desire for a puppy motivates him, this “greed” is not the main focus of the story. Instead, the wish for a puppy is part of the boy's imaginative way to give himself a goal and help him face his fears. He tells himself, “If I get across safely, without being burnt and without being bitten, I will be given a puppy for my birthday tomorrow.” This reward is more of a fantasy he uses to encourage himself, rather than true greed.

At the beginning, the child is scared, especially when he looks at the scab on his knee and thinks about it. His fear increases when he looks at the carpet and imagines it full of dangers like burning coals and poisonous snakes. However, he gathers courage and confidence to face these imaginary obstacles. He turns the carpet into a challenging adventure where he can prove his bravery. Motivated by the hope of the puppy, he moves forward carefully and bravely, trying his best to overcome his fear.

Even though the puppy is part of the challenge, it acts as a tool that pushes him to keep going rather than a selfish desire. The story shows how a child's imagination can transform an ordinary situation into an opportunity to face and conquer fears safely. In this way, the story highlights the power of self-confidence and determination, showing that courage can help us overcome even the scariest challenges.

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. Do you think our wish can be fulfilled? Why or why not?</p>
        <p>= I believe that whether our wishes are fulfilled depends largely on our own actions and determination. Simply wishing for something without putting in any effort rarely leads to success. Wishes are like seeds they have the potential to grow into something meaningful, but only if we nurture them through hard work, patience, and persistence.

Many people have dreams and desires, but only those who take consistent steps toward their goals can hope to see their wishes come true. For example, a student may wish to get good grades, but unless they study and prepare, that wish alone won't make a difference. Similarly, an athlete may wish to win a competition, but only rigorous training and dedication will help achieve that.

Besides effort, sometimes external factors like timing, luck, and support from others can influence whether a wish is fulfilled. Life is unpredictable, and despite our best efforts, some things might not happen exactly as we want. However, having a positive attitude, being flexible, and learning from failures can increase the chances of turning wishes into reality.

In summary, wishes are important as a starting point, but they become meaningful only when combined with determination, action, and resilience. Without effort, a wish remains just a hope; with effort, it can become a goal  and eventually, a success.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. Why do you think some people might have a frightening nature? What would you suggest to them to overcome it?</p>
        <p>= Many people develop a frightening nature because fear is a natural and protective response to things that feel unknown, dangerous, or overwhelming. Often, this fear comes from past experiences where they may have faced failure, rejection, or even trauma. These experiences can make someone cautious or anxious, especially when facing new challenges. Sometimes, growing up in an environment that lacked encouragement or confidence-building can also cause a person to be fearful.

In addition, fear often stems from low self-confidence. When people doubt their abilities or compare themselves harshly to others, they may feel powerless and afraid to try new things. Fear can also arise from uncertainty about the future or the pressure to succeed, which can be overwhelming and stop someone from taking risks or moving forward.

To help someone overcome this frightening nature, I would suggest several steps:

1. Acknowledge and Accept Fear: Recognizing that fear is a normal human emotion is important. Accepting fear rather than avoiding it helps reduce its power over us. Facing fears gradually can make them less intimidating.

2. Build Confidence Slowly: Setting and achieving small, manageable goals helps build self-confidence. Every small success boosts belief in oneself and encourages taking on bigger challenges.

3. Use Positive Self-Talk: Changing negative thoughts like “I can't do this” into positive affirmations such as “I will try my best” can improve mindset and reduce anxiety.

4. Learn from Failures: Understanding that mistakes and failures are part of learning can help reduce the fear of trying. Each failure is a chance to grow stronger and wiser.

5. Seek Support from Others: Talking to trusted friends, family, or mentors provides encouragement and guidance. Sharing fears openly often makes them easier to face.

6. Practice Relaxation Techniques: Activities like deep breathing, meditation, or exercise help calm the mind and reduce stress, making it easier to handle fearful feelings.

7. Be Patient and Persistent: Overcoming fear is a journey, not an instant fix. With patience, consistent effort, and a positive attitude, anyone can develop courage and overcome their frightening nature.

Ultimately, fear is something everyone experiences, but it doesn't have to control us. By taking small steps and believing in ourselves, we can turn fear into strength and grow as individuals.</p>
