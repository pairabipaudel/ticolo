        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In this essay, Steve Jobs shares important life lessons through three personal stories. First, he talks about how dropping out of college and taking unusual classes, like calligraphy, helped him later in designing Apple products. This shows how sometimes things that seem unimportant at first can become very useful later, and we should trust our instincts even when the future is unclear.
</p><p>
Second, Jobs tells about losing his job at Apple, the company he started, and how this difficult time led him to new opportunities and success with other projects. This taught him that setbacks can actually lead to growth and that it's important to keep loving what you do.
</p><p>
Finally, he speaks about facing his own death after being diagnosed with cancer. This experience made him realize how precious life is and how important it is to live authentically following your heart and not living according to others' expectations.
</p><p>
Jobs ends by encouraging everyone to “Stay hungry. Stay foolish,” meaning to always stay curious, eager to learn, and brave to take risks.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. What is the story about Steve Jobs' birth?</p>
        <p>= Steve Jobs was born to a young college student who was not married. She decided to give him up for adoption because she wanted him to grow up in a good family. At first, a lawyer's family wanted to adopt him, but when he was born, they changed their mind and said they only wanted to adopt a girl. Later, a mechanic named Paul Jobs and his wife Clara adopted Steve. They promised to send him to college one day.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. What does he mean when he says, “you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards”?</p>
        <p>= When Steve Jobs says, “you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards,” he means that we don't always know how things happening now will help us later in life. But if we look back, we can see how everything fits together and makes sense. Life is full of surprises, and everyone fails sometimes. What's important is to learn from those mistakes and keep trying. Steve Jobs had many hard times too — like breaking up with his girlfriend and not getting a job he wanted. But in the end, all those experiences helped him succeed. So, instead of worrying about failures, we should trust that one day, when we look back, we will understand why everything happened the way it did.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. What happened when Steve Jobs turned 30?</p>
        <p>= When Steve Jobs turned 30, something very hard happened to him. The company he started, Apple, was doing well, but the people in charge, called the board of directors, decided to fire him. Even though he was the one who created the company and worked very hard, they took his job away. This was a big shock and made him very sad. It felt like he had failed. But Steve didn't give up. After he was fired, he started new projects and worked hard again. Later, he came back to Apple and helped make it very successful. This shows that even when bad things happen, we can still come back and do great things.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. Jobs contends that you need to love to do what you do in order to be great at it. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I agree with Steve Jobs that we need to love what we do to become really good at it. When we love something, we enjoy working on it and don't get tired easily. It helps us keep trying even when things are hard. Success needs hard work and patience, and if we don't like what we do, it becomes difficult to keep going. But when we are passionate and enjoy our work, we can do better and achieve great things. So, loving what we do is very important to become successful.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Is death really life's greatest invention?</p>
        <p>= Yes, death is life's greatest invention because it is something that everyone will face one day. No one wants to die, but it is a part of life that we cannot avoid. Instead of being scared or worried about death, we should focus on living our life well and doing great things while we are alive. Death reminds us to make the most of the time we have.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Explain the following lines:</p>
        <strong>i. “You have to trust in something — your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever.”</strong>
        <p>= In this line, Steve Jobs tells us that we need to trust something whether it's our feelings, fate, life, or what we believe in. He means that believing in ourselves and having faith is very important. When we trust ourselves, we feel confident and motivated. This helps us keep going, even when things are hard. Without this trust and belief, it is difficult to succeed. So, trusting in something helps us follow our own path and reach our goals.</p>
        <strong>ii. “Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life.”</strong>
        <p>= In this line, Steve Jobs is saying that our life is short and we should not waste time trying to live like someone else or follow what others want us to do. If we do that, we might lose our own way. Instead, we should listen to our own feelings and dreams, and use our time to become the person we really want to be. This way, we can live a happy and true life.</p>

We should keep trying and working hard until we get the best result. Instead of just chasing success, we should focus on doing our best and being excellent. When we do excellent work, success will come naturally. So, never give up or accept less than what you want.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Which style of speech is used by the speaker to persuade the audience?</p>
        <p>= The speaker, Steve Jobs, uses a personal and informal style of speech to persuade his audience. Instead of using formal or complicated language, he talks to the listeners like he is sharing his own life story and experiences. This makes his speech feel natural and easy to relate to. He uses a narrative style, which means he tells real stories about his struggles, failures, and successes. By doing this, he connects with the audience on a personal level and shows that he understands what it means to face challenges.
</p><p>
His speech is also short, simple, and direct. He avoids using difficult words or long explanations, which helps the audience follow his message easily. Throughout the speech, he encourages and motivates people by reminding them to trust themselves, follow their passion, and never give up. He shares important life lessons in a way that feels friendly and honest. This style helps to inspire the listeners and makes his advice more powerful. Because of this personal and storytelling approach, the audience is more likely to listen carefully and feel inspired to act on what he says.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. It is not easy to motivate others. How do you think Steve Jobs' speech is so inspiring?</p>

He doesn't just give advice; he shares true stories from his own life, including the struggles and sacrifices he faced. These stories make his message more believable and powerful. When people hear about his hardships and how he overcame them, they feel encouraged that they can do the same, no matter where they come from or what difficulties they face.

His speech is also easy to understand because it is simply organized and spoken in a natural way. He connects with the audience by talking about things many people can relate to, like failure, fear, and hope.

        <p className='question'>f. Why do you think Steve Jobs used the personal narrative story telling technique in his speech? What influence does it have on the audiences?</p>
        <p>= I think Steve Jobs used personal storytelling in his speech because it helps him connect with the audience in a deeper way.

</p><p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. One of Steve Jobs mottos was: 'Think differently'. Can this make a person succeed in life? What challenges are there in thinking differently?</p>
        <p>= Yes, thinking differently can help a person succeed in life. Success often comes when we try new ideas and do things in ways others have not done before. If we always follow what others do, it is hard to stand out or achieve something great. Thinking differently helps us create new paths and find better solutions.
</p><p>
But thinking differently is not easy. It needs courage, patience, and learning from real experiences. Sometimes, when we think or act differently, people around us may not understand or support us. They might call our ideas strange or even say we will fail. This can make us feel discouraged. But it is important to believe in ourselves and stay confident. We should trust our own thoughts and keep trying even if others don't agree. By doing this, we can overcome challenges and become successful. So, thinking differently is very powerful, but it also needs strength to face difficulties and keep going.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. What does the slogan “Stay hungry; stay foolish” mean to you?</p>
        <p>= The slogan “Stay hungry; stay foolish” means that we should always keep wanting to learn more and never feel fully satisfied with what we have achieved. “Stay hungry” means always having a strong desire to grow, improve, and achieve new goals. “Stay foolish” means not being afraid to take risks, try new things, and make mistakes, even if others think it's silly.
</p><p>
To me, this slogan encourages us to keep dreaming big and working hard without losing our curiosity and passion. It reminds us not to stop after reaching some success but to keep pushing forward. This attitude helps us become better and reach even greater heights in life.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. What does it mean to be a visionary? What makes Steve Jobs different from a fortune teller?</p>
        <p>= Being a visionary means having a clear idea or dream about how the future can be better. A visionary thinks about new things that can change the world. Steve Jobs was a visionary because he imagined new technology that could help people in many ways.
</p><p>
Steve Jobs is different from a fortune teller because a fortune teller only guesses what might happen in the future. But Steve Jobs didn't just guess, he worked hard to make his ideas real. He showed people a new way to do things and helped change the world. Visionaries like Jobs don't just think, they also act to make their dreams come true for everyone's good.</p>
