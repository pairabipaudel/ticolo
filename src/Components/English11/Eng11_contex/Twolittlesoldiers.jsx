        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>“Two Little Soldiers” is a story about two best friends named Luc and Jean, who are soldiers living in France. Every Sunday, they get a break from their military duties and go to the countryside to relax and enjoy a peaceful day away from the strict army life. They bring food, talk, and enjoy the calm nature that reminds them of home.</p>
<p>
One day, they notice a village girl who brings her cow to graze in the same field. After a while, the girl starts talking to them and even shares some milk with them. They become friends, and soon the soldiers look forward to seeing her every Sunday. Luc and Jean even bring her sweets, and their small friendship becomes something they treasure a lot.
</p><p>
But then things change. Luc suddenly starts acting differently—he takes leave from the army during weekdays, borrows money from Jean, and doesn't say why. The next Sunday, the girl greets Luc with a hug and a kiss, and Jean is completely left out. He is heartbroken and confused because his best friend and the girl seem to have kept a secret from him.
</p><p>
Later that day, while walking back to the barracks, they stop at a bridge. Jean leans over the edge too far and suddenly falls into the river. Luc watches helplessly as his best friend drowns. The story ends in sadness, leaving the reader to feel the deep pain of lost friendship, jealousy, and emotional betrayal.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer these questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why do the two soldiers spend their free time on Sundays away from the barrack out in the countryside?</p>
        <p>= The two soldiers, Luc and Jean, spend their Sundays in the countryside because it gives them peace and reminds them of their village and home. Life in the army barracks is strict and dull, but the countryside is calm, green, and beautiful. It helps them feel closer to the simple and happy days they used to have before joining the army. They enjoy the fresh air, the quietness, and the comfort of nature, which helps them forget the stress of being soldiers, even if it's just for a day.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Why does the girl become the topic of conversation for these soldiers?</p>
        <p>= The girl becomes the main topic of conversation for the two soldiers because both Luc and Jean develop feelings for her. Her presence adds excitement and joy to their otherwise routine Sundays. At first, they simply enjoy watching her from a distance, but once she starts talking to them and sharing milk and meals, their connection grows stronger. She becomes the highlight of their week, and they can't help but think and talk about her even when they're back at the barracks. Her kindness, beauty, and friendliness make a lasting impression on both of them, causing her to become a special part of their lives and conversations.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why does deception enter into their friendship?</p>
        <p>= Deception enters into their friendship because Luc begins to secretly leave the barracks during the week to meet the village girl without telling Jean, his close friend. At first, both Luc and Jean shared a strong bond and spent Sundays together in the countryside, enjoying the simple pleasure of watching the girl and talking to her. However, when Luc starts visiting the girl alone, he breaks the unspoken trust between them. He even borrows money from Jean without explaining the reason. This secretive behavior shows that Luc is hiding something, and it creates distance and emotional pain for Jean, ultimately damaging their friendship.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. Do you think that Luc is a betrayer of friendship?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I think Luc can be seen as a betrayer of friendship because he breaks the mutual trust he shared with Jean. Both friends seemed to have equal affection for the village girl and had always spent time together during their Sunday visits. However, Luc secretly begins to meet the girl alone during the week without telling Jean, even borrowing money from him under false pretenses. This act shows that Luc knowingly hides his intentions, despite being aware of Jean's feelings. While falling in love is not a crime, doing so by going behind a close friend's back and being dishonest about it reflects betrayal in friendship. Luc's actions cause deep emotional pain for Jean and ultimately lead to a tragic ending.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. What is the cause of suicide of Jean? Do you think that it was the only release of his love?</p>
        <p>= Jean took his own life because he was deeply hurt after seeing that his best friend Luc was in love with the same girl he liked. Jean felt very sad and betrayed when Luc and the girl hugged and kissed in front of him. He didn't know how to deal with his feelings, and he kept everything inside.
</p><p>
But no, suicide was not the only way to handle this. Jean could have talked to Luc or the girl about how he felt. Or he could have tried to move on and focus on his own life. Even though love can be painful, time helps people heal. There are always better ways to deal with heartbreak than ending your life.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Is it good to have conflict between friendship and love? Is it morally good that a person and his best friend can love the same person?</p>
        <p>= No, it is not good to have conflict between friendship and love because both are very important relationships in a person's life. True friends and loved ones support each other, help us grow, and bring happiness during tough times. They make life better by sharing good moments and reducing stress.
</p><p>
Regarding two people loving the same person, it is not morally wrong as long as their feelings are genuine and pure. Such situations can happen naturally in life. However, this can cause problems if not handled well. The best way to deal with this is through honest communication and managing emotions carefully to protect both the friendship and the feelings involved.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. How would you describe the triangular love?</p>
        <p>= Triangular love is a complicated type of relationship that involves three people connected by feelings of love or affection. In such relationships, each person might have feelings for one or both of the others, which can create a mix of emotions like love, jealousy, and rivalry. It is different from a simple romantic relationship between two people because the involvement of a third person adds complexity and often leads to conflicts.
</p><p>
In the story “Two Little Soldiers,” the triangular love is between the two friends, Luc and Jean, and the young village girl they both care about. At first, their friendship is strong, and they share happy moments together. However, when both Luc and Jean fall in love with the same girl, their friendship is tested.
