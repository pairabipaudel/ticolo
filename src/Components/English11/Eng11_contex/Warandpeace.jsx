        <h3>Comprehension</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer these questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why was the Italian Socialist Mergari treated like a madman?</p>
        <p>= The Italian Socialist Mergari was treated like a madman because he spoke simple and honest truths that others did not want to hear. His natural and human words made people uncomfortable, so they ignored him or treated him as if he were crazy.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Can political aims be attained by the criminal instrumentality of war? If yes, how?</p>
        <p>= Yes, political aims can sometimes be achieved through war, even though war is a harmful and destructive method. Leaders can inspire strong feelings of patriotism and nationalism in people, making them willing to fight and even die for their country. This strong unity and sacrifice can help a country achieve its political goals during war.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Which hopes and plans were said to be mutually contradictory?</p>
        <p>= The hopes for peace and the plans for a large-scale massacre were said to be mutually contradictory. This means that wanting peace and planning a terrible war could not happen at the same time.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. What can be the sacred duty of every man of good will on earth?</p>
        <p>= The sacred duty of every person with good intentions is not to ignore problems or stay indifferent, but to do everything they can to stop a terrible disaster from happening.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Is it good to tacitly accept war as an instrument of politics? If not, what else should be done?</p>
        <p>= No, it is not good to silently accept war as a way to solve political problems. War causes great suffering and destruction. Instead, people and leaders should work together to find peaceful solutions through talks, understanding, and cooperation. If we truly want peace, we can stop war by choosing dialogue over fighting.</p>
        <p className='question'>f. How can we stop war in the world?</p>
        <p>= We can stop war in the world if we stop being lazy, careless, or afraid to take action. Instead of accepting or ignoring war, we must actively work to stop it. We should not let the “machines of war” keep moving forward, but instead choose peace, understanding, and cooperation.</p>
        <p className='question'>g. What is the main message of this essay?</p>
        <p>= The main message of this essay is that peace is necessary and can be achieved if peqaZople seriously work together to stop war. Instead of spreading hatred and fighting, we should promote peace, friendship, and brotherhood among all people around the world.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Are warmongers the greatest enemies for peace? What do you want to suggest to them?</p>
        <p>= A warmonger is a person who wants war instead of peaceful solutions. Yes, warmongers are the greatest enemies of peace because they encourage fighting and violence. They often push countries to attack or fight each other, causing a lot of harm.
</p><p>
However, not all wars are started for bad reasons. Some wars happen to protect peace and safety or to stop violence. But warmongers who only want to create destruction and suffering are definitely obstacles to peace.
</p><p>
To warmongers, I would suggest that they stop and think about what they are doing. They should remember the value of human life and work to end conflicts instead of causing more harm. If they care about humanity, they will choose peace over war and help save many innocent lives.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. The Nobel Prize winner American novelist John steinbeck 1920 1968 on said “all war is a symptom of man's failure as a thinking animal.” Do you agree with the novelist? Why?</p>
        <p>= I  completely agree with John Steinbeck's statement that war shows how humans fail to think properly. War is one of the worst things in the world because it hurts everyone. No one really wins in a war. Both the winners and losers lose many lives and valuable resources.
</p><p>
Wars never solve problems; instead, they make things worse. The two World Wars are the worst examples of how destructive war can be. These wars caused so much pain and loss that it is hard to imagine anything worse in history. War happens because of people's ignorance, anger, and failure to find peaceful solutions. The world should learn from the terrible lessons of these wars.
</p><p>
One of the most horrible events in history was the dropping of nuclear bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II. Thousands of innocent people died instantly, and many more suffered for years afterward. After seeing such destruction, almost the whole world condemned the use of nuclear weapons. But the scary truth is that many countries still have powerful nuclear bombs ready to use. This shows how dangerous the world still is.
</p><p>
In conclusion, war is a sign that humans have failed to think wisely. Civilized people should solve their problems through talks and peaceful discussions. So, when war happens, it means that human thinking has failed</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Does any war end all wars and bring lasting peace to the world? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= War is a fight or conflict between countries or groups of people. Most wars start because of differences in opinions or interests. Sometimes people say a war to end all wars can bring peace, but that peace always comes with a huge cost — the loss of many lives and destruction of property. World War I and II caused terrible damage that can never be fully repaired.
</p><p>
War is not the only way to bring peace. There are better ways, like talking and negotiating fairly so both sides agree on a solution. When countries work together, they can find ways that help both sides. Even if people have different religions, colors, or live in different countries, we all belong to one human family. We should treat each other like brothers and sisters and solve our problems peacefully.
</p><p>
The two World Wars showed how painful war is for everyone involved. In fact, World War I ended not because of victory, but because the countries were tired and wanted peace. If it were not for this, wars could have gone on forever.
</p><p>
In my opinion, war will never bring real and lasting peace. It harms nations emotionally and economically. So, war is not the right way to create peace. We must find other peaceful ways to solve conflicts.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Why do you think countries go to war?</p>
        <p>= Countries go to war for many reasons, and it's usually not just one simple cause. Sometimes, they want to gain more land, money, or power, and they believe fighting is the only way to achieve that. One major reason is economic gain, where a country wants to control another country's resources. Another reason is territorial gain, which happens when a country wants more land for living space, farming, or other needs. Religion is also a big cause of war, especially when people strongly believe their religion is right and others are wrong. These conflicts can stay quiet for years and then suddenly come back. Nationalism, or extreme pride in one's country, can also lead to war when one country tries to prove it's better than others by force. Finally, revenge plays a big role, especially when a country wants to get back at another for something done in the past. All of these reasons can be connected, and they show that war is usually the result of many complicated issues. But no matter the reason, war always brings suffering, so it's better to solve problems through peace and understanding.</p>

        <strong>War and Peace</strong>
        <p>War and peace are two very different things. War is when countries or groups fight each other using weapons, armies, and violence. Peace is the opposite, it is calm, safe, and full of understanding. Both war and peace have played big roles in the history of the world, but most people agree that peace is always better.
</p><p>
War causes a lot of pain. When there is war, many innocent people die. Families are broken, cities are destroyed, and people live in fear. Some lose their homes, while others lose their loved ones. War doesn't just affect soldiers; it hurts normal people the most. Children have to stop going to school, and hospitals run out of medicine. Life becomes very hard. Even when the war is over, it leaves behind sadness, damage, and fear.
</p><p>
There are many reasons why wars happen. Sometimes it's because of greed, one country wants another country's land or resources. Other times it happens because of religion, politics, or because one country feels more powerful than the other. Sometimes, even small problems between leaders grow into big fights just because no one wants to back down. In the end, the ones who suffer the most are the people, not the leaders.
</p><p>
Peace, on the other hand, brings happiness. In peaceful times, people can live without fear. Children go to school, farmers grow crops, and people can work and enjoy life. Peace helps countries grow and develop. It also allows different cultures and communities to come together and share ideas. When there is peace, people are more focused on solving problems like poverty, climate change, and education, instead of fighting.
</p><p>
Keeping peace is not always easy. It takes effort, understanding, and forgiveness. People have to listen to each other, respect differences, and learn how to solve problems without fighting. Leaders of countries must think wisely and work together to avoid war. Even normal people can help keep peace by being kind to one another and spreading messages of love and unity.
</p><p>
History has shown us that war doesn't solve problems it only creates more. The two World Wars are examples of how dangerous war can be. Millions of people died, and even years after the wars ended, countries were still trying to rebuild. But history also shows that peace is possible. When countries stop fighting and start talking, great things can happen.
</p><p>
In conclusion, war brings destruction, while peace brings hope. We should always choose peace over war. No matter how big the problem is, there is always a peaceful way to solve it. As young students, we should learn to be kind, respectful, and understanding. That way, we can grow up and help build a world where peace is stronger than war.</p>

        <strong>Responsive Youths for Peace and Prosperity</strong>
        <p>Young people are the future of every country. They have energy, ideas, and dreams. If they use these things in the right way, they can help make the world a better place. Responsive youths are those who care about their country and want to do something good. They are ready to take action, solve problems, and spread peace and happiness.
</p><p>
Peace means living without fighting or hurting others. But peace is more than just no war, it means understanding, kindness, and respect for everyone. If young people talk politely, listen to others, and solve problems calmly, they help build peace. Even in small places like schools or homes, peace starts when we behave nicely and help each other.
</p><p>
Prosperity means people living a good life with enough food, jobs, health care, and education. When young people work hard, study well, and learn new skills, they help their family and country grow. Some youths even start small businesses or help others in their community. These small things lead to big changes and help bring success to everyone.
</p><p>
Being a good and responsive youth is not always easy. It means doing the right thing, even when it's hard. It means not wasting time, avoiding bad habits, and trying to help others. If we care about our society, our environment, and people in need, we are already making a difference.
</p><p>
Schools, parents, and the government should also support youths. They should give them chances to learn, lead, and grow. But at the same time, young people must take responsibility too. They should not just wait for change, they should be the change.
</p><p>
In the end, young people have the power to bring peace and prosperity. If we all become responsible and kind, we can build a happy and strong nation. It starts with us — one step at a time.</p>
