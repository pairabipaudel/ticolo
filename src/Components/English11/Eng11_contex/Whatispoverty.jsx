        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The essay “What is Poverty?” is written by Jo Goodwin Parker, who tells us what it really feels like to live in poverty. She shares how hard and painful it is to live without enough money and how she struggles every day to take care of her family. Parker says poverty is much worse than what we see in the news or hear from others.
</p><p>
She explains poverty as not having the basic things in life like good food, medicine, clean water, and education. Poverty is like an acid that destroys a person's pride, health, and hope for the future. She wants readers to understand how shameful and hard life is for poor people.
</p><p>
Parker tells about her own life with three children. She had to leave her husband because he lost his job and they could not afford birth control. She worked, but it was very hard to take care of her children. One day, she found her kids in a dangerous and dirty place while she was at work. She earned 20 dollars a week, but it cost 20 dollars a week to send all three children to nursery school. So, she had to stop working.
</p><p>
Parker describes herself as dirty and poor, without enough clothes or things like soap, hot water, or medicine because everything costs too much. She says that even though there are some government help programs, they don't exist near her home or she cannot afford to travel to them. She can't get a better job because she can't pay for child care.
</p><p>
Poverty for her means looking at a dark and hopeless future, especially for her children. She does not want people to feel sorry for her, but she wants them to understand what poverty really is.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. What is poverty according to Parker?</p>
        <p>= According to Parker, poverty means not having enough money to buy the basic things needed for life, such as good food, education, and medical care. She says poverty is like a strong acid that destroys a person's pride, health, and hope for the future. In simple words, poverty is living without hope and without the things that make life better, like good food, proper healthcare, and education.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. How is poverty difficult for Parker's children? List some specific examples.</p>
        <p>= Parker's three children suffer a lot because of poverty. They do not have enough good food, clean clothes, education, or care. Parker tells us how hard their life is. For example, they eat cornbread without oil for breakfast, wear dirty clothes, and do not go to school. One day, when Parker was at work, she left her children with their grandmother. When she came back, she saw her youngest child covered with flies and his diaper had not been changed all day. The second child was playing with broken glass, and the oldest was playing near a lake, which was unsafe. The children often had to play in dirty places. These things show how hard poverty is for Parker's children.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. How does Parker try to obtain help, and what problems does she encounter?</p>
        <p>= Parker tries to get help from many people, but she faces problems and gets rejected. She asks her relatives for a loan, but they want something in return. She goes to different offices to find a job and ask for loans too. She has to tell many people about her sad situation to get help. Once, someone asks if she needs help, but that person is not the right one to help her. She goes to another office and tells her whole story again, but it is also the wrong place. So, she has to start all over again. Parker faces many difficulties while trying to get help.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. Why are people's opinions and prejudices her greatest obstacles?</p>
        <p>= People's opinions and prejudices are her biggest problems because they stop her from getting the help she needs. Many people don't understand how hard it is to live in poverty. They think being poor is a punishment and that it's easy to fix, so they don't take her problems seriously. Some even try to use her weakness to get something from her. Because of these unfair ideas and attitudes, she finds it very hard to get support.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. How does Parker defend her inability to get help? How does she discount the usual solutions society has for poverty (e.g., welfare, education, and health clinics)?</p>
        <p>= Parker explains that she can't get help because of the way poor people are treated. She talks about her hard life and says poverty destroys pride, health, and hope. She has to go to many places to ask for welfare, but she feels ashamed and is often rejected. She has to prove she is poor again and again, which is very humiliating.
</p><p>
Even though there are programs for education, they don't really help her children much. She sent two of her children to school but still they suffered. Health clinics are far away from where she lives, so she can't easily get medical help. When she asks people for help, some expect bad things from her. Parker shows that being poor is not just hard but also shameful and unfair.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Explain the following: Poverty is looking into a black future.</p>
        <p>= The line "Poverty is looking into a black future" is said by Jo Goodwin Parker in her essay. She uses this line to show how hard life is for poor people. Poor families cannot provide good food or education for their children. They also cannot keep clean or stay healthy because they don't have enough money. This situation causes many problems like sickness, hunger, joblessness, and even crime. That's why poverty leads people toward a dark and hopeless future. Poor people live a sad life every day with no hope for things to get better. Poverty destroys their dreams and hopes for the future.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. What does Parker mean by “The poor are always silent”?</p>
        <p>= When Parker says “The poor are always silent,” she means that poor people feel helpless because they don't have money for things like healthcare, medicine, good food, or education. When it comes to money, they cannot speak up or complain because they simply cannot afford expensive things like medical treatment, eating in restaurants, wearing nice clothes, or going to good schools. They have no voice in these situations because they feel powerless and trapped. Their lives are very sad and difficult, and they cannot fight back where money controls everything.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What writing strategy does the author use at the beginning of most of the paragraphs? Do you notice a recurring pattern? What is it?</p>
        <p>= In the essay, the author uses a writing method called repetition. This means she repeats the same words or phrases many times. At the beginning of most paragraphs, she starts with the phrase “Poverty is”. This is a clear pattern that happens again and again in her writing. By repeating these words, she wants to keep the reader's attention on the main topic, which is poverty. She wants the reader to understand that poverty is the most important issue she is talking about.
</p><p>
This repetition also helps the writer to show her strong feelings about how painful and difficult life is when a person is poor. It makes the essay feel very personal, like she is talking directly to someone who does not know what poverty really means. This way of writing makes the readers feel connected to her story and understand her problems better.
</p><p>
Also, her writing style is simple and easy to follow, so anyone can understand the message she wants to share. Sometimes, she uses a little bit of humor or irony to show the unfairness of the situation. Overall, the repeated use of “Poverty is” helps to keep the essay focused and powerful.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. How does Parker develop each paragraph? What details make each paragraph memorable?</p>
        <p>= Parker develops each paragraph by starting with the same phrase “Poverty is,” which she repeats many times throughout the essay. This helps to keep the main idea clear and focused. After this, she shares her own real-life experiences and feelings about poverty to explain what she means by each statement. This way, she connects her ideas to personal stories, making her writing more powerful and real.
</p><p>
The images and examples she uses to describe poverty are very strong and easy to remember. For example, she says that poverty is like a chisel that slowly breaks away a person's honor. This means poverty doesn't just affect money or food, but also a person's pride and respect. She also talks about how poor people often feel ashamed or less important because they don't have money. Even if a person is smart or talented, poverty makes it hard for them to be respected by others who have wealth.
</p><p>
What makes each paragraph memorable is Parker's honest and sad stories about her life. She shares how hard it is to take care of her children without enough money, how she had to quit her job because she couldn't afford childcare, and how people judge or ignore her because she is poor. These personal details show the painful reality of poverty and help readers feel sympathy and understand the real struggles poor people face every day.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. In the final paragraph, how does the author use questions to involve the reader in the issue of poverty?</p>
        <p>= In the final paragraph, the author uses questions to speak directly to the readers and make them think deeply about poverty. She writes in a simple and informal way, almost like having a personal talk with the reader. She asks, “Can you be silent too?” This question is very powerful because it asks readers to imagine themselves in the same situation as poor people who feel silent and helpless.
</p><p>
By asking this question, Parker wants readers to understand how hard it is for poor people to speak up or get help. She is saying that the silence of poor people is not because they don't want to speak, but because of their difficult situation. She challenges the readers to think if they themselves could stay quiet if they were poor. This makes readers feel connected to the problem and encourages them to think about how they react to poverty.
</p><p>
Parker also wants the readers to feel responsible and stop ignoring poor people. She wants people to stop thinking only about themselves and start caring about others who are suffering. The question is like a wake-up call, asking readers not to be silent but to help and support poor people for a better future.
</p><p>
By using this question, Parker makes the readers feel emotional, guilty, and thoughtful about poverty. It makes the readers stop and think seriously about what they can do to help. This way, the author involves the readers directly in the problem of poverty and encourages them to take action. </p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Define a social problem (homelessness, unemployment, racism) imitating Parker's style.</p>
        <strong>A Social Problem: Unemployment</strong>
        <p>Unemployment is when you don't have a job and don't know what to do. It is waking up in the morning with nothing to look forward to. It is watching other people go to work while you stay at home, feeling sad and useless.
</p><p>
Unemployment is when you want to work, but no one gives you a chance. You walk into offices, fill out forms, and ask for work, but they say, “Sorry, we don't need you.” You come home tired, but still have no money.
</p><p>
Unemployment is when your children ask for food, clothes, or school fees, and you have nothing to give. It hurts. You feel like a failure. It makes you feel small and ashamed. You start to believe you are not good enough.
</p><p>
Unemployment is not just about not having a job, it's about losing your confidence. It makes you worry all the time. You cannot sleep at night. You feel alone. It is hard to smile when you are always scared about tomorrow.
</p><p>
I don't want people to feel sorry for me. I just want them to understand how hard it is. This is what unemployment feels like for many people. It is real. It is painful. And it needs to change.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Using adjectives to highlight the futility of the situation, write a short definition essay on Growing up in Poverty.</p>
        <strong>Growing Up in Poverty</strong>
        <p>Growing up in poverty is a painful, lonely, and hopeless experience. It is living every day in a dirty room with a leaky roof, empty stomach, and torn clothes. It is watching other children go to school with clean uniforms and full lunchboxes, while you walk with broken shoes and an empty bag.
</p><p>
Growing up in poverty means feeling unwanted and forgotten. It means listening to your parents argue about money every night. It means eating dry bread for dinner and pretending to be full so your little sister can eat more. It is being sick but unable to go to the doctor. It is using old newspapers instead of notebooks.
</p><p>
It is frustrating, tiring, and unfair. The dreams are big, but the chances are small. The days are long, and the nights are cold. No one hears your silent cries. Poverty becomes your shadow. You carry shame, fear, and sadness every day.
</p><p>
Growing up in poverty doesn't just mean being poor in money. It means growing up with broken hopes, silent wishes, and a heart full of unanswered questions. It teaches you to survive but not to live.</p>
