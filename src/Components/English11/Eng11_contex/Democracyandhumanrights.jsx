        <p>a. What were the restrictions imposed on the Blacks in South Africa?</p>
        <p>= The restrictions imposed on the Blacks in South Africa included racial segregation, political disenfranchisement, and economic discrimination.

        <p>c. How did he describe racism and racial oppression?</p>
        <p>= He described racism and racial oppression as a very harmful and unfair way of thinking and behaving that hurts people and must be removed from society.</p>
        <p>d. Why did he thank all the international guests?</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What does Mandela mean when he says 'a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world?'</p>
        <p>= When Mandela says “a rainbow nation at peace with itself and the world,” he means that South Africa should become a united and harmonious country where people of all races Black, White, and others live together peacefully without fear or discrimination. Just like a rainbow is made up of different colors existing side by side in beauty and harmony, he envisions a nation where people of diverse backgrounds come together to form a stronger, more inclusive society.
</p><p>
In South African culture, the rainbow symbolizes hope and a bright future. The term “rainbow nation” represents the unity of different racial, cultural, and ethnic groups after a long history of division and apartheid. Mandela's vision was to leave behind the painful past of racism and violence, and instead build a peaceful, just, and equal nation where everyone is respected and valued.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Mandela should have avenged those who imprisoned him for such a long period. Instead, he followed the path of reconciliation. Why do you think he did so?</p>
        <p>= Mandela chose the path of reconciliation instead of revenge because he believed that hatred and vengeance would only lead to more conflict and division in the country. He knew that if he focused on punishing those who had imprisoned him, he would not be able to achieve his dream of a united and peaceful South Africa.</p>
        <p>Even though he had suffered greatly, Mandela forgave his oppressors and encouraged all South Africans to work together, regardless of their race. He understood that true leadership means putting the nation above personal pain. Revenge would have created more violence, while forgiveness opened the door to healing and unity.</p>
        <p>By promoting reconciliation, Mandela earned the respect of both Black and White South Africans and successfully led the country toward democracy and peace. His decision showed his strength, wisdom, and deep commitment to justice and equality for all.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Why and how have societies struggled with segregation in the world? Do you find any evidence of segregation in your society? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= Segregation has been a long-standing issue in many parts of the world, often dividing people based on race, religion, caste, or ethnicity. Societies have struggled with segregation because it creates inequality and weakens unity. When one group is treated as inferior, it leads to tension, unfair treatment, and missed opportunities for development. From apartheid in South Africa to racial segregation in the United States, history shows us how deeply harmful separation can be when one group dominates over another.</p>
        <p>Segregation doesn't always happen through laws; sometimes it exists silently through customs and traditions. Schools, neighborhoods, and workplaces may still show signs of separation, even in modern, democratic societies. People may not openly talk about it, but unequal treatment still exists.</p>
        <p>In my own society, I have noticed that certain castes and ethnic groups are still treated differently. Even though our constitution guarantees equal rights for all, the reality is more complex. Some families still prefer not to marry outside their caste. Others may look down on certain jobs or communities, believing them to be "lower" in status. This kind of thinking continues to divide people and limit progress.</p>
        <p>To truly end segregation, we must change our mindset, not just our laws. Respecting every individual regardless of their background is key to building a fair and united society. Real change starts with how we treat each other in everyday life.</p>
