        <p className='question'>Summary</p>
        <p>The poem "Corona Says" gives a voice to the coronavirus itself, as if the virus is talking directly to us. It tells us that the pandemic happened because humans have been careless and greedy toward nature. We have polluted the earth, destroyed forests, and harmed animals without thinking about the consequences. The virus says it came as a kind of punishment or lesson because of how badly we treated the world.

The poem also reminds us that while many people are suffering, the pandemic has allowed nature to breathe again. The air is cleaner, rivers are clearer, and animals can roam freely because people are staying indoors. It's like the Earth finally got some rest.

The virus warns us to think carefully about how we live and treat our planet. It tells us that the Earth is not just for humans but for all living creatures. If we don't change our ways and keep harming nature, worse problems will come, and our future will be in danger. The poem ends with hope, saying we can overcome this disease if we learn to live more kindly and peacefully with nature.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. What does the speaker mean when he says:</p>
        <p>But have you ever counted
How many have died so far
Because of you and your wars?</p>
       <p>= In these lines, the speaker blames human beings for causing wars and the resulting loss of lives. The speaker points out that the damage caused by wars is even worse than that caused by the pandemic. Wars often happen because of disputes over resources, land, or a government's desire for more power and control. The people who start wars rarely consider the terrible consequences for ordinary people. Millions of lives and properties are lost, and the effects of war continue to harm people both physically and mentally long after the fighting ends.</p>

        <p>b. Explain the following:</p>
        <p>I will depart one day.
But remember
There're many others like me.
They'll come too.
If you don't get rid of your inflated ego,
You'll be back to your cave time
That you endured
Long, long, long ago â€¦</p>
<p>= In these lines, the speaker warns us to stop being arrogant and selfish. No matter who we are, we must respect and protect nature and follow its laws. The poet tells us that while this pandemic may end, other deadly diseases can come if we keep harming the environment. If we don't change, our careless actions might even lead to the destruction of human civilization. It's a strong reminder to be humble and live in harmony with nature to avoid going back to a difficult, primitive life.</p>

      <div>
        <p>c. What does the speaker mean in the following lines? Explain.</p>
        <p>The earth is not your property alone -
It's as much ours as yours.</p>
<p>= In these lines, the speaker means that the Earth is a shared home for all living beings, not just humans. Every creature animals, plants, and people has an equal right to live and use the Earth's resources. However, humans often act as if they own the Earth and control everything, thinking they are superior to other life forms. The speaker is warning that this selfish behavior harms nature and destroys the balance of life. It reminds us to respect and protect the environment, understanding that we all depend on the Earth together.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. What human behaviours are responsible for suffering in people's lives?</p>
        <p>= Human behaviors are the main cause of suffering in people's lives. Due to human ego, greed, and bad actions, the world is facing many crises. Many lives have been lost during these difficult times. Because of selfishness, the Earth has suffered from diseases and other problems. Wars and conflicts caused by pride have taken many lives. So, human beings themselves are responsible for much of the pain and suffering in the world.

Behaviors like greed, selfishness, violence, and disrespect for nature create problems not only for others but also for ourselves. When people fight over resources, pollute the environment, and harm other living things, it disrupts the natural balance. Ignoring this balance leads to disasters like diseases, poverty, and loss, causing fear and suffering for many.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. How does an epidemic differ from a pandemic? Briefly explain the impact of Corona Virus on human life and environment.</p>
        <p>= An epidemic is when a disease spreads quickly in a small area or a country. A pandemic is when a disease spreads all over the world and affects many people in different countries.

The Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic affected people's lives a lot. Many people got sick or died. Because of the virus, people had to stay at home, stop traveling, and keep distance from others. Many lost their jobs and felt lonely or worried.

But the pandemic also helped the environment a little. Since people stayed home, there was less pollution. The air became cleaner, rivers were clearer, and animals came back to places they usually avoid. This showed us how much humans affect nature and reminded us to take better care of the Earth.</p>
