        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>“Civil Peace” is a story about Jonathan Iwegbu, a man living in Nigeria shortly after the civil war. Jonathan considers himself extraordinarily lucky because he, his wife, and three of his four children survived the war. Even his house and bicycle, which he carefully protected during the conflict, are still intact. Jonathan often says, “Nothing puzzles God,” to explain both his good fortune and the hardships he faces.
</p><p>
After the war, Jonathan works hard to rebuild his life. He uses his bicycle as a taxi and opens a small bar to earn money. His family also helps by cooking food and selling fruit. Since the coal mine where he used to work has not reopened, Jonathan's determination and resilience are essential for the family's survival and comfort.
</p><p>
One day, Jonathan receives a reward of twenty pounds for turning in rebel currency. However, that same night, thieves break into his home and demand money. Afraid for his family's safety, Jonathan gives the thieves the reward money. Despite the theft, Jonathan remains calm and optimistic, reminding himself and his neighbors that the reward is small compared to what he lost during the war.
</p><p>
The next morning, Jonathan and his family return to their work, focusing on rebuilding their lives. The story highlights Jonathan's positive attitude, resilience, and gratitude in the face of difficulties. “Civil Peace” teaches readers the importance of hope and hard work, even during challenging times.

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why did Jonathan think of himself as 'extraordinarily lucky'?</p>
        <p>= Jonathan considered himself 'extraordinarily lucky' because despite the horrors and destruction of the Nigerian Civil War, he, his wife, and three of his four children survived safely. Many people lost their lives or homes during the war, but Jonathan was grateful that his family remained together and alive. This survival made him feel blessed and fortunate compared to others who suffered greater losses.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. What are the 'five blessings' for which Jonathan is grateful?</p>
        <p>= The 'five blessings' Jonathan is grateful for are the lives of himself, his wife Maria, and three of their four children. He calls them blessings because they all survived the Nigerian Civil War. Even though they lost one child, Jonathan is deeply thankful that five members of his family are still alive and safe. To him, life itself is the greatest gift.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why did Jonathan mistrust the officer who wanted to take his bicycle? What does this tell you about the situation in Nigeria?</p>
        <p>= Jonathan mistrusted the officer who tried to take his bicycle because the officer seemed more interested in taking a bribe than doing his duty honestly. Instead of officially claiming the bicycle for the army, the officer accepted money to leave it with Jonathan. This shows that the situation in Nigeria after the war was full of corruption and dishonesty. Government officials were not trusted, and ordinary people had to protect their belongings by offering bribes. It also reflects the instability and lawlessness in the country during that time.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. What visitors might be at the door? Are Jonathan and his wife completely surprised? Explain.</p>
        <p>= The visitors who knock at Jonathan's door late at night are likely thieves. Jonathan and his wife are not completely surprised, but they are very frightened. They had heard about robberies happening in their area after the war, so deep down they knew something like this could happen. However, the violent knocking in the middle of the night still shocks and terrifies them, especially because they know they are helpless and there is no one to protect them.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. Why does no one in the neighborhood respond when the thieves pound on Jonathan's door? Why do the thieves call for the police?</p>
        <p>= No one in the neighborhood responds when the thieves pound on Jonathan's door because they are all too afraid. After the war, people were living in fear and had learned not to get involved in others' problems, especially when it came to dangerous criminals. Everyone was just trying to protect themselves.
</p><p>
The thieves mockingly call for the police to show how helpless Jonathan and his family are. They know no one, including the police, will come to help. By pretending to call for the police, they make fun of the situation and prove that there is no real law or safety anymore.</p>

        <h3>Reference in the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What does Jonathan mean by his expression “Nothing puzzles God”? What does this expression reveal about his character? Explain by citing details from the story.</p>
        <p>= In the story “Civil Peace” Jonathan often uses the phrase “Nothing puzzles God” whenever something surprising, whether good or bad, happens in his life. He says it first when he finds his bicycle still in good condition after digging it up from where he had buried it during the war. He repeats it again when he sees that his house is still standing while many others were destroyed. The final time he uses the phrase is after thieves rob him of the 20 pounds he received as ex gratia payment, yet he remains calm and thankful for what he still has.
</p><p>
By saying “Nothing puzzles God,” Jonathan means that while things may surprise humans, nothing surprises or confuses God. God knows everything and allows things to happen for a reason. This expression reveals that Jonathan is a deeply optimistic and faithful man. He doesn't let sorrow or hardship break his spirit. Instead of complaining about what he loses, he focuses on what he still has. His trust in God helps him accept life's ups and downs with patience and gratitude. This makes Jonathan a symbol of resilience, hope and faith in the story.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. How does Jonathan change as he experiences the conflicts in his life? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Jonathan is a hardworking and optimistic man who strongly believes in both his efforts and in God. Throughout the story, he faces many hardships, including the loss of one of his children during the Nigerian Civil War. Despite this painful loss, he still considers himself lucky for having "five inestimable blessings" his own life, his wife, and three surviving children.
</p><p>
As Jonathan experiences these conflicts, he adapts and becomes even more resilient. He does not sit back and grieve endlessly; instead, he takes action to support his family. He uses his bicycle as a taxi, repairs his damaged house, and opens a small bar to earn income. He accepts the new reality after the war and adjusts his life to meet the needs of his family.
</p><p>
Jonathan's experiences teach him to focus on what he has rather than what he has lost. His faith in God and his belief in hard work help him stay hopeful. Rather than being broken by conflict, Jonathan grows stronger, more accepting, and more faithful. This shows that conflict transforms him into a symbol of endurance, faith, and positivity.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Nigerian English has words like soja 'soldier' and katakata 'confusion', 'trouble' derived apparently from English words but transformed by native languages' phonologies. What does the author's use of dialect here add to the story?</p>
        <p>= The author's use of Nigerian English dialects such as soja (soldier) and katakata (confusion or trouble) adds cultural richness and authenticity to the story. These words reflect how English has been adapted by Nigerian speakers and shaped by local languages.
</p><p>
Using these dialects helps the reader better understand the everyday life, struggles, and identity of Nigerian people during the post-war period. It also brings the characters to life more vividly, making their voices sound real and rooted in their culture. The use of dialect:
</p><p>
1. Highlights the native flavor of the language spoken by ordinary Nigerians
</p><p>
2. Promotes cultural authenticity and national identity
</p><p>
3. Gives readers insight into the local way of speaking and thinking
</p><p>
4. Reflects the social status and lifestyle of the characters in the story
</p><p>
By including local expressions, the author strengthens the connection between the reader and the Nigerian setting, making the story more engaging and meaningful.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. Why do you think the thieves who come to rob Jonathan speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan does?</p>
        <p>= The thieves speak English with a heavier African accent than Jonathan to show that they are likely less educated and come from a rougher background. Their accent reflects their social and educational status, which is different from Jonathan's, who appears to be more well-spoken and respectful. The use of a stronger local accent also helps the author highlight the difference between ordinary hardworking people like Jonathan and those who have chosen a life of crime. It adds realism to the story and reflects the variety of voices in Nigerian society after the war.</p>
      </div>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>f. The title of the story "Civil Peace" itself is ironical as there is little to differentiate 'civil peace' from 'civil war'. Do you think that the title of this story is appropriate, or would “Civil War” have been a better title? Explain.</p>
        <p>= The title “Civil Peace” is very suitable but also ironic. The story is about Jonathan Iwegbu trying to rebuild his life after the Nigerian Civil War. Even though the war is over, the place is still full of problems like crime and fear. For example, thieves come to rob Jonathan's house even when it is supposed to be peaceful.
</p><p>
The title is ironic because the “peace” after the war is not real peace. Life is still hard and unsafe. If the story was called “Civil War”, it would only focus on the war itself and miss the important idea that life after war is also full of struggles.
</p><p>
The title “Civil Peace” makes readers think about how difficult it is to have true peace after a war. It shows both hope and the reality of the difficult time after the war ends. So, the ironic title fits the story very well.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. How would you describe the civil peace in Nigeria?</p>
        <p>= As we know, war can never bring true peace; it is never the solution to any problem. The civil peace in Nigeria after the war was far from good. Although the war had ended, people were still struggling to rebuild their lives. It was a time of resettlement, but not much had improved, and life was still difficult for many. They faced many challenges such as poverty and insecurity.
</p><p>
The government had laws, but they were not strong enough to protect everyone. Thieves and criminals were still active, looting and hurting people without fear of being caught. Even though the war was over and civil peace was supposed to exist, there was still a lot of chaos and disorder. In short, the peace was weak and unstable.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. What kind of attitude towards life do you think you would have if your situation was similar to that of Jonathan's?</p>
        <p>= If my situation was like Jonathan's, I think I would first feel very thankful to God for not losing more, because I know how terrible war can be. I would be grateful to still have my family and my home. At the same time, I believe I would try to have the same optimism and hope for my life and loved ones, just like Jonathan. I would be ready to face any challenges to protect and support my family. I would work hard and keep faith in God to help me through difficult times. I would also try to avoid violence and stay calm in tough situations. Honestly, I don't know if I could be as positive as Jonathan is, but I really admire how he handles everything with hope and strength. I wish I could face difficulties the way he does calm, hopeful, and hardworking.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. Draw the character sketch of Jonathan Iwegbu.</p>
        <p>= Jonathan Iwegbu is a well-developed character who shows strong optimism throughout the story. Despite facing many difficulties, he remains calm, peaceful, and hopeful. Jonathan is a static character, meaning he doesn't change much during the story. He accepts the past but doesn't waste time dwelling on it; instead, he focuses on dealing with whatever comes next.
</p><p>
Even though Jonathan lost one of his children during the war, he doesn't let grief overwhelm him. He feels thankful that he, his wife, and three of his children survived. His positive attitude is clear when he calls his old bicycle a “taxi,” showing that he looks for new opportunities rather than feeling hopeless.
</p><p>
When Jonathan returns to his broken house, he stays calm and begins repairing it instead of getting angry. Since his old job at the coal mine is no longer available, he works hard to start new businesses, like running a bicycle taxi and opening a bar for soldiers.
</p><p>
Even when thieves come to rob him, Jonathan tries to handle the situation peacefully. He gives them the money he has without losing his calm or giving up hope. Overall, Jonathan is a positive person who always looks at the bright side of life and feels grateful for what he has, rather than being ungrateful or bitter about what he lost.</p>
