        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>Ivan Dmitri Aksenov was a young merchant from Vladimir who once lived a carefree life enjoying all worldly pleasures until he got married. One summer, he planned to visit the Nizhny fair despite his wife's warning about a bad dream where Ivan returned with grey hair. Laughing off her fears, he set out on his journey. Along the way, he met a merchant and spent the night drinking tea with him. The next day, two soldiers stopped Ivan and accused him of murdering that merchant, leading to his arrest despite his innocence.
</p><p>
Aksenov spent twenty-six years in prison, where he transformed into a humble and God-fearing man, gaining respect from fellow prisoners. A new inmate named Makar Semyonich arrived, and over time, Aksenov discovered that Makar was the true murderer. Though furious, Aksenov kept the secret. One night, Makar threatened him to stay silent about the tunnel he was digging to escape. Eventually, Makar confessed his crime to the prison authorities and apologized to Aksenov, promising to secure his release.
</p><p>
However, Aksenov did not desire freedom anymore because he had no family or home left to return to. He waited quietly for death. When the order to free him finally arrived, it was too late, Aksenov had already passed away. The story shows the power of patience, forgiveness, and faith that truth will ultimately be revealed, even if it takes a lifetime.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Which symbols are used in the story and what do they indicate?</p>
        <p>= In “God Sees the Truth, But Waits”, Leo Tolstoy uses powerful symbols to highlight deeper meanings in the story. One important symbol is Aksenov's house and two shops, which represent his past life, including his family, material wealth, and his connection to the outside world. They symbolize his happiness, freedom, and involvement in worldly affairs before he is falsely accused.
</p><p>
Another significant symbol is the Siberian prison, where Aksenov spends 26 years of his life. The prison represents his long suffering, isolation, and injustice. However, it is also a symbol of his spiritual awakening and transformation. Through hardship, Aksenov becomes humble, faithful, and forgiving. The prison walls, which physically trap him, also become the place where he finds inner peace and spiritual freedom.
</p><p>
Together, these symbols reflect the journey from worldly loss to spiritual gain, showing how true peace comes not from material things, but from faith, acceptance, and forgiveness.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What role does religion play in Aksionov's life? How does he undergo a spiritual transformation in the story?</p>
        <p>= Religion plays a central role in Aksenov's life, especially after he is falsely imprisoned. At first, he feels hopeless and abandoned, but over time, he begins to place all his faith in God. Despite suffering for 26 years for a crime he didn't commit, he becomes calm, humble, and spiritually strong. He lets go of anger and hatred, accepting that only God knows the truth and will reveal it at the right time.
</p><p>
When Makar, the real murderer, confesses, Aksenov doesn't react with anger or revenge. Instead, he forgives Makar and finds peace through that act of forgiveness. This shows his deep spiritual transformation — from a man who once lived for material success to someone who fully trusts in God's justice. Even when he is finally granted freedom, Aksenov dies in prison, but with peace in his heart and faith in God.
</p><p>
The story teaches us that even in the darkest times, if we keep believing in God and stay patient, truth and justice will come — just as the title says: “God Sees the Truth, But Waits.” Aksenov's journey is a powerful example of how suffering can lead to spiritual awakening and inner peace.

        <p className='question'>b. What does the story tell us about the existence of an unfair system of justice?</p>
        <p>= The story God Sees the Truth But Waits by Leo Tolstoy clearly reveals the existence of an unfair and flawed justice system. It shows how a person who is completely innocent can still be wrongly punished due to poor investigation, false evidence, and quick judgment. Aksenov, the main character, is a kind and honest man who is falsely accused of murdering a fellow merchant. Even though he had no involvement in the crime, all the clues and circumstantial evidence pointed towards him, and without any proper defense or chance to prove his innocence, he was sent to prison for twenty-six long years.
</p><p>
During all those years, the real murderer, Makar Semyonich, lived freely without guilt or punishment. This shows how the true criminal escaped justice while the innocent man suffered. It reflects a legal system where truth does not always win immediately, and innocent people can become victims of injustice. Aksenov's suffering highlights the painful consequences of such a flawed system where justice is not properly served.
</p><p>
This story teaches us that human systems of law are not always fair or accurate. Sometimes the truth takes time to come out, and even though the legal system may fail, a higher justice exists. That is why the title of the story is so meaningful. God Sees the Truth But Waits reminds us that while human justice can make mistakes, divine justice never fails, it simply takes time.</p>
