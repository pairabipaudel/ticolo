        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The play Refund is about a man named Wasserkopf who is unhappy with his life and blames his school for it. He thinks the school didn't teach him anything useful, which is why he isn't successful. Even though he graduated 18 years ago, he goes back to his old school and demands a refund of the money he paid for his education.
</p><p>
The school principal and teachers are shocked but come up with a smart plan. They tell Wasserkopf he can only get his money back if he fails a re-exam. Secretly, the teachers decide to pass him no matter what, so they won't have to give the refund. During the exam, Wasserkopf gives silly and wrong answers on purpose, but the teachers twist his answers to make them sound clever or creative, and they mark him correct each time.
</p><p>
At the end of the exam, the mathematics teacher asks him one last question: “If you had to refund the tuition fees, how much money should the school give you?” Wasserkopf gives the correct amount without thinking. The teachers immediately say, “That's correct! You passed the test!” Since he passed, they don't return the money. Wasserkopf is confused but has no choice and leaves without getting the refund.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why does Wasserkopf demand a refund of his tuition fees from the school?</p>
        <p>= Wasserkopf demands a refund of his tuition fees because he believes he didn't learn anything useful in school. He says that even after 18 years of education, he is still unsuccessful and has no good job or respect in society. He feels the school failed to teach him anything valuable, so he wants his money back.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Why does Wasserkopf consider himself good for nothing?</p>
        <p>= Wasserkopf thinks he is good for nothing because he couldn't succeed in life even after getting an education. He didn't get a proper job and failed many times. He feels that the school didn't teach him anything useful, so he blames the school for his failure.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What did the teachers decide to do when Wasserkopf asked for a refund?</p>
        <p>= When Wasserkopf asked for a refund, the teachers decided to give him a re-examination. But they secretly planned to pass him no matter what. Even if his answers were wrong, they would find a way to prove he was right. This way, they wouldn't have to return the tuition fees.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Why did Wasserkopf give ridiculous answers? Why did the teachers accept these answers?</p>
        <p>= Wasserkopf gave silly and wrong answers on purpose because he wanted to fail the exam. He thought that if he failed, the school would have to return his tuition fees. But the teachers didn't want the school's name to be damaged. So, they cleverly accepted all of his strange answers and found tricky ways to prove that he was actually right. This way, they made sure he passed and didn't get any refund.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. How does the Mathematics Master describe Wasserkopf's character?</p>
        <p>= The Mathematics Master says that Wasserkopf is a clever and tricky person. He knows Wasserkopf is trying to fail the exam on purpose just to get his money back from the school. He also says that Wasserkopf is rude and uses bad language, which annoys all the teachers. Still, the master understands that Wasserkopf is not a fool he is smart but using his brain for the wrong reason.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. How did the teachers outwit Wasserkopf?</p>
        <p>= Wasserkopf gave silly and wrong answers on purpose because he wanted to fail the test and get his money back. But the teachers were smarter than him. They decided to trick him instead. The Mathematics teacher gave him an easy question: to calculate how much money the school should refund. Wasserkopf answered it quickly and correctly. Then the teacher said that solving this question showed he was a math genius. All the teachers agreed and declared that he passed the exam. So, Wasserkopf didn't get his refund. In this clever way, the teachers outsmarted him.</p>

        <p className='question'>g. What is the final judgment on Waserkopf's demand of refund?</p>
        <p>= In the end, Wasserkopf doesn't get any refund. The principal announces that he has passed the re-examination with excellent marks in every subject. The school says he has proved once again that he truly deserves the graduation certificate they gave him before. So, his demand for a refund is rejected.</p>

        <strong>iii. Where is the speaker at this moment?</strong>
        <p>= He is in the principal's office at the school.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Read the extract dialogue given below and answer the questions that follow:</p>
        <p className='question'>“THE STAFF: (bowing, heartily) How do you do?</p><p className='question'>
WASSERKOPF: Who the hell are you? Sit down, you loafers! (He grins, waiting to be thrown out)</p><p className='question'>
THE PRINCIPAL: How dare you –”</p>
        <strong>i. What is to be the response to 'How do you do?'</strong>

        <strong>ii. Is Wasserkopf's response polite enough to the staff?</strong>
        <p>= No, Wasserkopf is very rude. He uses bad words and talks disrespectfully to the staff.</p>
        <strong>iii. How does Wasserkopf rebuke the staff?</strong>
        <p>= He calls them “loafers” (which means lazy people) and says “Who the hell are you?”</p>
        <strong>iv. What does the principal mean by 'How dare you -'?</strong>
        <p>= The Principal means Wasserkopf has no right to speak disrespectfully to the teachers and staff.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. Explain the following line of the play:</p>
        <p className='question'>“Because I didn't get my money's worth, that's why!”</p>
        <p>= This line is spoken by Wasserkopf, who is the main character in the play. He says this line to explain why he has come to his old school and is asking for a refund of the money he paid for his education. Wasserkopf feels that the school did not teach him anything useful during the many years he spent studying there. He thinks that despite spending a lot of time and money on his education, he has not learned enough to succeed in life.
</p><p>
Because of this, he has failed many times in his exams and has also lost jobs because he is not skilled or knowledgeable. He believes that the education he received was a waste of time and money. So, he wants the school to return his tuition fees since he did not get what he paid for — which is good education and useful knowledge.
</p><p>
Wasserkopf also tells the principal that if he is given another chance to take the exams again, he will show that he did not learn anything from the school. He is confident that the school's teaching was so poor that even if he tries again, he will still fail. This, he thinks, will prove that the school is responsible for his failure and that his demand for a refund is fair.
</p><p>
In simple words, Wasserkopf feels cheated by the school because he paid for education but ended up with no useful knowledge or skills. That's why he says, “Because I didn't get my money's worth.”</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>d. What is the theme of the play?</p>
        <p>= The main theme of the play is a criticism of the education system. It shows how the school and teachers fail to prepare students properly for real life. The play makes fun of how sometimes students finish school without learning anything useful, just like the character Wasserkopf. He spent many years in school but still did not get the knowledge he needed to succeed.
</p><p>
The play also shows the cleverness of the teachers when they deal with Wasserkopf. Even though Wasserkopf is rude and asks for a refund, the teachers use their smartness to handle the situation in a funny way. They don't just give him the money back but find a way to teach him a lesson.
</p><p>
Overall, the play uses humor and wit to show the problems in education and how sometimes it does not help students become ready for life. It also shows how teachers can be wise and clever when faced with difficult situations.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. Sketch the character of Wasserkopf.</p>
        <p>= Wasserkopf is a man around forty years old. He is from Hungary and lives a poor life. He is angry, rude, and very short-tempered. He has been fired from many jobs because of his bad behavior and lack of manners. Instead of accepting his own faults, Wasserkopf blames his old school for not teaching him anything useful. That's why he returns to the school to ask for a refund of his tuition fees, claiming that his education was worthless.
</p><p>
Wasserkopf is also a lazy and careless man. He did not study seriously when he was a student. He just wanted to pass the exams without learning. Later in life, he realizes that he knows nothing — not even simple things like currency exchange. Because of this, he cannot get a proper job and ends up struggling financially.
</p><p>
He is also shown as a man who doesn't respect others. He speaks very rudely to the teachers and even insults them by calling them “loafers.” He uses harsh and insulting words, showing that he lacks basic discipline and good manners.
</p><p>
Wasserkopf thinks he is clever and tries to cheat the school by giving wrong answers during the re-examination. He hopes that if he fails, the school will be forced to return his money. However, the teachers are smarter than him. They twist his wrong answers into right ones and declare him passed. In the end, Wasserkopf gets nothing, and the teachers protect the school's reputation.
So, Wasserkopf is shown as a foolish, greedy, and disrespectful man who is outsmarted by the very teachers he thought were fools.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. The play is a satire on the present day education system. Do you think that our education system does not prepare students for life? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I do think that our education system does not fully prepare students for real life. Most of the time, students are taught to memorize facts and lessons just to pass exams, but they don't really understand how to use that knowledge in daily life. Schools and colleges focus more on theory and less on practical skills.
</p><p>
Also, students often focus only on getting good marks instead of gaining real knowledge. Subjects that could teach life skills, like communication, teamwork, problem-solving, or how to handle money, are often ignored or not given importance. As a result, when students leave school or college, they feel lost and unprepared to face real challenges like finding a job, managing finances, or dealing with real-world problems.
</p><p>
In the play Refund, Wasserkopf feels that his education gave him nothing useful. This is something many students today can relate to. So yes, our education system needs to change. It should focus more on helping students grow into capable, responsible, and confident people ready to live successful lives.</p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p className='question'>b. Our education system focuses on memorisation rather than creative thinking. Do you think the knowledge imparted by education may not have practical relevance in one's day-to-day life? Who do you blame for this?</p>
            <p>= Yes, I do believe that the education system today does not always help students with real-life skills. Many students learn just by memorizing books and notes without really understanding what they are studying. They focus more on getting good marks in exams than on learning things that will help them in their future lives. For example, many students can write answers in exams very well, but they do not know how to solve real-life problems or how to speak confidently or think in creative ways.
</p><p>
The knowledge they get from school or college is often not used in their daily lives. We are taught many subjects and topics that do not help us deal with day-to-day challenges like managing money, handling stress, writing job applications, or speaking in public. This is one of the biggest problems in our education system.
</p><p>
I think the government is mainly responsible for this issue. The curriculum or course we follow is made by education boards and the government. They still focus on theory and not on practical learning. Schools give more importance to written exams than real experiences, group work, or learning life skills.
</p><p>
But we cannot only blame the government. Students also have a role in this. Most students are just focused on passing exams and getting high grades. They do not try to go beyond the textbooks or learn things that might help them in the future. They just follow what the teacher or the book says and never ask, “Why is this useful?” or “How can I use this in my life?”
</p><p>
So, in my view, both the government and students are responsible. The government should make the education system more skill-based and creative. And students should try to learn with more curiosity and interest, not just for marks but for knowledge that helps them live a better and smarter life.</p>
        </div>
        <hr/>
        <div>
            <p className='question'>c. Most of the students want to learn just for examination rather than knowledge. Do you think that certificate will help them in their future career?</p>
            <p>= Yes, it is true that many students today only study to pass exams and get good marks. They focus more on getting a certificate than gaining real knowledge. Their goal is to pass the exam, not to understand the subject well. They often memorize answers without thinking deeply about what they are learning. This may help them get a good grade for now, but it does not prepare them well for the future.
</p><p>
A certificate alone is not enough to build a good career. In real life, skills and knowledge matter more than just a piece of paper. Many students who get good certificates do not get good jobs because they lack the skills employers are looking for. For example, someone may have a degree, but if they don't know how to communicate well, solve problems, or work in a team, they will struggle in the workplace.
</p><p>
There are many examples of people in Nepal who have degrees, but because they don't have useful job skills, they end up going abroad to do hard physical labor. This is sad, because they spent years studying, but their education did not really help them. The main reason is that they learned only for exams, not for life or work.
</p><p>
A certificate is important, but it is not everything. It should be the result of true learning, not just memorization. If a student learns with interest, asks questions, and understands the subject deeply, then the certificate will have real value. But if they only study to pass the test, the certificate becomes just a piece of paper, not a sign of their talent.
</p><p>
So, in the end, I believe that real learning is more important than just getting a certificate. A good future depends on knowledge, skills, and the ability to think, not just exam results.</p>
