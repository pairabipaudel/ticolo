        <p className='question'>a. How did Mahabir Pun begin his lifelong journey in Nepal after coming back to Nepal from the US?</p>
        <p>= Mahabir Pun began his lifelong journey by returning to his home village, Nangi in the Myagdi district, where he volunteered as a teacher to help establish a high school for the villagers.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Why didn't he want to work for other companies in the US or in Nepal?</p>
        <p>= He didn't want to work for other companies in the US or in Nepal because he preferred to work independently and do something on his own for the benefit of humanity, rather than just seeking a so-called better living.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. Why did he involve in innovation?</p>
        <p>= He got involved in innovation to find solutions to problems.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. What are the income-generating programmes that he helped to start?</p>

        <p className='question'>e. Whose support is Pun getting to proceed with his campaign?</p>
        <p>= Pun is getting support from local communities to proceed with his campaign.</p>
        <p className='question'>f. How have the developed countries become prosperous?</p>
        <p>= The developed countries have become prosperous because they give top priority to research and innovation and invest a huge amount of money in it.</p>
        <p className='question'>g. How can we keep the most talented and innovative people in Nepal?</p>
        <p>= We can keep the most talented and innovative people in Nepal by creating a sound and supportive environment where they can work peacefully and productively.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Pun says, “We do not have culture of innovation that encourages young people to be innovative and creative”. Do you agree with him? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I agree with Pun. An innovation culture refers to the mindset within a society or organization that supports and promotes creative thinking and experimentation. It plays a crucial role in the success of innovation by providing an environment where new ideas are welcomed and nurtured. Without a positive culture, even the best ideas or teams can fail to produce results.
</p><p>
Nepal is considered a developing country, but its development process is progressing very slowly. One of the main reasons is that our education system is still heavily focused on traditional classroom learning and memorization. It rarely encourages creativity, critical thinking, or research-based education. Opportunities for young people to explore new ideas or start innovative projects are very limited.
</p><p>
As a result, many talented students leave the country every year in search of better education and opportunities. In contrast, developed countries invest heavily in research and innovation, creating systems that empower young minds. In Nepal, young people are often discouraged from taking risks, and the lack of supportive systems and resources holds back their potential.
</p><p>
Therefore, I believe that without a culture of innovation, it will be very difficult for Nepal to retain its most creative and talented youth.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. What qualities does an individual need to become an entrepreneur?</p>
        <p>= An entrepreneur is a person who starts and runs a business, taking financial risks in hopes of making a profit. Entrepreneurs are innovative pioneers who identify opportunities and create new markets both locally and globally. Being an entrepreneur offers many advantages such as the freedom to be your own boss, the potential for unlimited income, the chance to work on your own ideas, personal satisfaction from building something new, and the ability to create jobs for others. However, becoming an entrepreneur requires more than just a creative idea. Successful entrepreneurs share several key qualities that help them overcome challenges and achieve their goals. Vision, the ability to see potential success, and careful planning are essential to avoid unforeseen problems. Perseverance and self-discipline help entrepreneurs stay motivated and focused even during difficult times. Good time management and knowing when to delegate tasks boost efficiency and growth. Leadership skills and confidence earn respect from others while comfort with risk and uncertainty is necessary because entrepreneurship involves ups and downs. Overall, qualities such as vision, planning, perseverance, discipline, time management, confidence, and risk taking are crucial for anyone who wants to succeed as an entrepreneur.</p>
