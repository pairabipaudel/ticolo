        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The play begins in a quiet park where Dona Laura comes in with her maid, Petra. She sits on a bench and starts feeding birds with breadcrumbs. At the same time, Don Gonzalo arrives with his servant, Juanito. He wants to sit on the same bench but hesitates because Dona Laura is already there. He complains quietly, blaming the priests for taking his usual spot. Don Gonzalo feels unhappy about his life and keeps grumbling, while Dona Laura quietly shares her own frustrations when people disturb her. At first, they are both cautious and unsure about each other, but as they talk more, they start to understand one another.
</p><p>
They share some snuff (a type of tobacco), and their tone becomes friendlier. Their conversation moves to books, and Dona Laura reads a poem from a book Don Gonzalo gave her. This surprises both of them, they realize they were once lovers many years ago, but they don't want to admit who they really are. So, they pretend to be friends of the people they used to be. Dona Laura says she is a friend of 'The Silver Maiden' Laura Llorente, and Don Gonzalo says he is a cousin of Don Gonzalo.
</p><p>
Laura Llorente lived in Valencia and was called 'The Silver Maiden' because of her beauty. Every morning, Don Gonzalo would ride his horse past her house and toss flowers up to her balcony. In the afternoon, she would toss flowers back to him. When Laura's parents wanted her to marry a merchant, Don Gonzalo fought the merchant in a duel and hurt him badly. Afraid of the trouble, Don Gonzalo ran away. Laura waited for him but didn't hear from him, so one day she went to the beach and was almost swept away by the waves while thinking about him.
</p><p>
Don Gonzalo tells his own story about his cousin, saying that after the duel he fled to Seville and Madrid. He wrote many letters to Laura, but her parents took them away. When he got no answer, he joined the army and died in Africa, always thinking of Laura.
</p><p>
In truth, after two years apart, Laura married someone else and settled down. Don Gonzalo also married a ballet dancer and lived in Paris. Even though they moved on, they never forgot their deep love. When they meet again in the park after nearly 50 years, they remember their young love but choose not to reveal their true identities. They don't want to show how time has changed them.
</p><p>
The play “A Sunny Morning” entertains us with this touching and funny story about love, memory, and how people change with time.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. What makes Dona Laura think that Don Gonzalo is an ill-natured man? Why do neither Dona Laura nor Don Gonzalo reveal their true identities?</p>
        <p>= At first, Dona Laura thinks that Don Gonzalo is a rude and bad-tempered man. He doesn't want to share the bench with her and insists on having his usual spot. When he sees the priests sitting on his favorite bench, he gets angry and even tells his servant Juanito to go scare them away. He also scares the birds that Dona Laura was happily feeding. Because of his grumpy behavior, Laura feels that Gonzalo is not a kind person.
</p><p>
Later, when they both realize who the other person really is, they still don't tell the truth. They are now old, and both have lived different lives after their young love ended. Talking about their past openly might make them feel sad or embarrassed. So instead of saying they are the lovers from long ago, they pretend to be just friends of those lovers. This way, they avoid hurt feelings and enjoy a sweet, funny memory of their past.</p>
<p className='question'>b. At what point of time, do you think, Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognise each other?</p>
<p>= Laura and Gonzalo begin to recognize each other when they start talking about the old love story between a young girl named Laura Llorente and her brave lover. As they share the story, both of them know many small details that only the real people in the story would know. Laura says the girl was her best friend, and Gonzalo says the boy was his cousin, but in their hearts, they both understand the truth. Slowly, they realize that they are the same two lovers who were once deeply in love many years ago.</p>
<p className='question'>c. When does Dona Laura realise that Don Gonzalo was her former lover?</p>
<p>= Dona Laura realizes that Don Gonzalo was her former lover when he talks about the sad love story of Laura Llorente with deep feeling and detail. When she says the "Silver Maiden" had a sad ending, Gonzalo also reacts as if he personally knew what happened. At that moment, Laura understands that only her old lover would know so much about her past. This makes her sure that Don Gonzalo is the same man she loved many years ago.</p>
<p className='question'>d. Why do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo spin fictitious stories about themselves?</p>
<p>= Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo make up false stories about their past because they don't want to admit the truth of what really happened. They both want to show that they truly loved each other long ago, but their love failed because of fate, not because they gave up. They feel embarrassed to say that they moved on and married other people. So, by telling imaginary stories, they try to hide their weaknesses and make the other person feel sorry for them. It also helps them avoid the pain of remembering how their love ended.</p>
<p className='question'>e. How do Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo feel about each other?</p>
<p>= When Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo find out they were once in love, they feel happy and warm inside. They remember the old days and feel close again. Even though they are old now, they enjoy talking and being together. They feel good in each other's company and decide to meet again in the park. It shows that true love can still feel special, even after many years.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What is the effect of flashback in the play when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo knew that they were the lovers in the past?</p>
        <p>= The flashback in the play has a very important role. It helps the audience understand the deep connection between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo. At first, they meet as two strangers in a park. They are both old, and they do not recognize each other. They even argue and seem unhappy. But as they start talking about their past, they slowly begin to realize that they were once young lovers who were deeply in love.
</p><p>
The flashback takes us back many years, to the time when their love story began. It tells us how they used to exchange flowers, how they were separated by their families, and how their lives changed after that. It shows how both of them suffered in different ways, and how they never forgot each other, even after so many years.
</p><p>
This memory of the past brings a strong emotional feeling into the play. It shows us that even though time has passed, true love is never forgotten. The flashback also helps the two characters reconnect and understand each other again. Even though they don't say the truth directly, they know deep inside who the other person really is. They feel happy and comforted to meet again, even if they pretend to be just friends.
</p><p>
So, the flashback makes the play more touching, emotional, and meaningful. It helps the audience feel the power of love, memory, and second chances in life.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. How is the title 'A Sunny Morning' justifiable? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= The play “A Sunny Morning” is full of both humour and irony, which makes it very interesting and fun to watch.The biggest example of irony is that Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo are actually old lovers who once loved each other deeply when they were young. But now, when they meet again after many years, they don't tell the truth about who they really are. Instead, they pretend to be strangers and make up fake stories about themselves. Laura says she is the best friend of the “Silver Maiden,” and Gonzalo says that the Silver Maiden was his cousin. Everyone watching the play knows they are really talking about themselves but they are pretending not to know. This difference between what they say and what the audience knows is called dramatic irony, and it creates humour in the play.
</p><p>
Besides this, the way they talk to each other is very funny. They try to trick each other with clever and witty words. Laura often says things that leave Gonzalo speechless or confused, which makes the situation funny. For example, when Gonzalo says he went to America when he was six years old, Laura jokes that maybe he went there with Christopher Columbus, who discovered America. This silly comment shows the playful teasing between them.
</p><p>
Another funny moment is when Gonzalo uses his handkerchief to clean his shoes, and Laura jokes by asking if he uses a shoe brush as his handkerchief. These little jokes between them make the conversation lively and entertaining.
</p><p>
They also tell opposite stories about their pasts. Gonzalo tells a heroic story about how he escaped after hurting a man in a duel, while Laura tells a sad story about how the Silver Maiden (herself) was left alone and washed away by the sea. Both stories are made up, but they show how each tries to impress or gain sympathy from the other.
</p><p>
In all, the humour comes from their playful teasing, false stories, and the fact that they hide their real identities while still knowing the truth inside. The irony of pretending to be strangers when they were once lovers adds a gentle, funny, and sweet feeling to the play.
</p><p>
This use of humour and irony helps the audience enjoy the story more while also understanding the feelings of love, regret, and friendship that still remain between the two characters after many years.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What do you predict will happen in the next meeting between Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= I think when Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo meet again, they will be even more happy and excited than before. They will enjoy talking to each other and sharing their feelings, but probably still in a playful and pretend way. Even though they don't want to fully reveal who they really are, they will try to make each other feel good and have a nice time together.
</p><p>
Don Gonzalo may become more open and honest than before. He might show more respect and kindness towards Dona Laura, showing how much he still cares about her. At the same time, they might feel a little shy and nervous around each other, which will make their conversations sweet and interesting.
</p><p>
Because they are both pretending and making up stories, their next meeting will probably be full of funny moments and teasing, just like the first time. The readers or audience will get to see more of their playful tricks and gentle feelings. Overall, their next meeting will bring them closer as old friends and lovers, even if they don't say everything out loud.
</p><p>
So, I expect their next meeting to be full of warmth, fun, and quiet emotions that show their deep connection after many years apart.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Was it wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their identities secret? How might their secrets affect future meetings?</p>
        <p>= Yes, it was wise for Dona Laura and Don Gonzalo to keep their real identities secret. They are both around seventy years old and have already lived full lives apart. When they met again, they realized they were the old lovers who had to separate long ago because of bad luck. But now, after so many years, revealing who they really are might only bring sadness because they have both changed a lot and are no longer young or beautiful.
</p><p>
At this age, showing their true selves might remind them of the pain and lost time, making their meeting less joyful. So, it was better for them to pretend they didn't know each other and enjoy their happy memories without any pain. By keeping their identities secret, they protect themselves from feeling hurt again and can still share good moments together.
</p><p>
However, keeping such secrets might cause problems in the future. Since they are old, it could be difficult for them to keep pretending all the time, and there is a chance their true identities might come out accidentally. If that happens, it could change their meetings and feelings. They might become sad or uncomfortable, and their friendship might be affected.
</p><p>
But for now, hiding their real selves is the best way for them to enjoy each other's company and keep their love alive in a gentle and careful way. So, their decision to keep secrets was smart and helpful for both of them.</p>
