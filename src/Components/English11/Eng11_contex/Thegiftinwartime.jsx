        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The poem starts with the speaker giving nice and special gifts to someone called “you,” like roses and a wedding dress. But the “you” gives back medals and stars things that feel less personal and kind than what the speaker gave.
</p><p>
As the poem goes on, the speaker keeps giving important things, like their youth and even their happy springtime. But the “you” only gives back cold, hard things like the smell of blood and lips with no smile. The “you” doesn't seem to care about what the speaker is giving.
</p><p>
At the end, the poem talks about shrapnel pieces of bombs that the “you” gives. This makes it clear that the “you” might be war itself. War takes away everything good from people and gives back pain and suffering.
</p><p>
The poem shows how war forces people to lose everything that matters to them, while it only brings violence and sadness in return.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. What is the speaker's attitude toward war?</p>
        <p>= The speaker has a bitter and painful attitude toward war. She blames war for taking away her husband and causing deep sorrow in her life. To her, war brings loss, sadness, and emptiness. Instead of honor or pride, she sees war as something cruel that destroys love and happiness.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. In what ways do you think this person's fate has affected the speaker?</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What is the theme of the poem?</p>
        <p>= The central theme of the poem “The Gift in Wartime” is the cruelty, tragedy, and emotional destruction caused by war. The poem shows how war does not just take away lives on the battlefield, but it also deeply affects the loved ones left behind. Through the voice of a grieving woman, the poem reveals how war can rob people of their happiness, their dreams, and the people they care about most.
</p><p>
The speaker's husband dies in the war, and although he is honored with medals and badges, these symbols are meaningless to her. No award or tribute can fill the emptiness she feels or bring back the love and life she lost. The poem shows how war turns joyful moments, like springtime, into cold winters of sorrow. It reminds us that one life may end in war, but many others are broken forever families, partners, and friends all carry the pain.
</p><p>
Another important idea in the poem is that life is priceless, and once it is lost, there is no way to replace it. The poem criticizes how war takes lives without truly caring about the people behind them. Even though the soldier receives medals, they cannot comfort the woman or heal her pain. This shows the emptiness of such rewards in the face of personal loss.
</p><p>
Overall, the poem strongly delivers a message that war brings suffering, loss, and emotional scars that no recognition or ceremony can erase. It is a powerful reminder of how valuable peace is and how devastating the cost of war can be on human life and love.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. What imagery from the poem made the greatest impression on you? Why?</p>
        <p>= The poem uses many strong and emotional images, but the one that made the greatest impression on me is the image of the shrapnel. This small, sharp piece of bomb represents the pain, destruction, and lasting scars that war leaves behind. It is not just a physical object, it stands for everything that war takes away from people. The shrapnel reminds us that war doesn't just injure or kill soldiers on the battlefield, it also breaks the hearts and lives of those who love them.
</p><p>
What touched me most is how the speaker says she will carry the shrapnel to the next life as proof of their suffering. That one image shows the deep emotional wound left by war, one that doesn't heal even after death. It powerfully expresses how war destroys both the body and the soul, not only of the fighter but of their loved ones too. For me, this imagery captures the true horror of war in a way that is simple, yet unforgettable.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Which figurative language is used in the poem? Explain with examples.</p>
        <p>= The poem “The Gift in Wartime” uses different types of figurative language to show the deep pain of losing someone in war. These include irony, apostrophe, anaphora, imagery, and metaphor.
</p><p>
One strong example is irony. Normally, a “gift” is something good. But in this poem, the speaker receives things like a grave, shrapnel, and medals after losing her husband. These are not happy gifts, but symbols of pain and loss. That's what makes it ironic—the title talks about a gift, but it really shows how war only gives sadness.
</p><p>
Another figurative device is imagery. The poet uses words that help us picture things clearly. For example, when the speaker places roses on her husband's grave, we can feel her love and sorrow. When she describes his body with “lips with no smile” and “eyes with no sight,” we clearly see the sadness of death. The red roses also stand for love.
</p><p>
The poem also uses anaphora, which means repeating the same words at the beginning of lines. The speaker repeats “I offer you” in a few stanzas, and later, “you give me” is also repeated. This shows how the speaker gave love and life, while war gave her pain in return.
</p><p>
Another device used is apostrophe. That means talking to someone who isn't there. In this poem, the speaker is talking to her dead husband, even though he can't hear her. This makes the poem more emotional, as we can feel her love and longing.
</p><p>
These figures of speech help us understand the deep sadness, love, and anger the speaker feels because of war.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>d. What does the speaker “offer” in this poem? What does the person addressed as “you” give in return?</p>
        <p>= In the poem, the speaker offers many meaningful and heartfelt things to her beloved. She offers roses, her wedding gown, her youth, springtime, clouds, and even cold winters—all symbols of love, life, and sacrifice. These gifts show how deeply she cared and how much she gave emotionally and physically.
</p><p>
In return, the person she addresses as “you”—most likely her husband who died in war—gives her things that are cold and painful. He gives her medals with shining stars, a badge with yellow pips, the smell of blood from his uniform, lips without a smile, arms without tenderness, eyes without sight, and a body without motion. These are not real gifts—they are reminders of death, war, and loss.
</p><p>
This contrast shows how war takes away everything beautiful and gives back only sorrow and emptiness.

      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. An apostrophe is a literary device in which a writer or speaker talks to someone who is not present or to an idea, as if that person or idea could listen and understand. Discuss the poem in relation to apostrophe.</p>
        <p>= In this poem, the speaker uses apostrophe by talking directly to her dead husband as if he were still there and could hear her. She speaks to his lifeless body at his grave, offering him red roses and her wedding dress, showing her deep love and sadness. Even though he cannot answer or respond, she treats him like he is present.
</p><p>
She tells him how her youth ended with his death and remembers the medals and badges he received, which now only remind her of pain and loss. Her feelings are so strong that she imagines him listening to her grief and sacrifices. This way of speaking helps express her sorrow and the bitterness she feels about war and loss.
</p><p>
The use of apostrophe in the poem makes the speaker's emotions more personal and powerful, as she reaches out to someone she loves but can no longer hold or talk to.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. One way to get relief from grief is to write or talk about it. In your opinion, how might the speaker in this poem have benefitted from saying what she did? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Grief means feeling very sad because we lost someone we love. One way to feel better is to talk or write about our feelings. When we share our pain, it helps us heal a little bit. In this poem, the speaker talks to her dead husband to express her sadness.
</p><p>
By talking to him, she can face her pain instead of hiding it. She gives him red roses and her wedding dress at his grave to show her love and respect. She also thinks about how her life changed after he died and how the medals and blood on his clothes remind her of the pain of war. She feels like her happy days ended and her life became cold and sad.
</p><p>
Talking to her husband helps her feel connected to him and makes her grief easier to bear. It helps her cope with the loss and keep his memory alive.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Write an essay on the effects of war.</p>
        <p>= War is one of the most terrible things that can happen to people and countries. It brings many bad effects not only to soldiers but also to their families and the whole society. War affects everyone's life in a negative way, and its consequences last for a long time.
</p><p>
First, war causes a lot of loss of life. Many brave soldiers lose their lives fighting on the battlefield. Their families lose loved ones and suffer great pain. The death of a family member leaves behind sadness, loneliness, and sometimes even poverty. When a soldier dies, it is not only his life that ends but also the hopes and dreams of those who love him.
</p><p>
Second, war destroys homes and communities. During wars, many cities and villages are bombed or attacked. Houses, schools, hospitals, and important buildings are damaged or destroyed. This leaves many people without shelter, food, or medicine. Life becomes very hard for those living in war zones. Children may lose their chance to study, and families may have to move away from their homes as refugees.
</p><p>
Third, war affects the mental and emotional health of people. Soldiers often suffer from fear, sadness, and trauma after seeing violence and death. Even people who are not directly involved in fighting can feel scared and worried about their safety. Families who lose their loved ones feel deep grief and may find it hard to live a normal life again.
</p><p>
Moreover, war wastes resources that could be used for development. Money spent on weapons and battles could be used to build schools, hospitals, and roads. Instead, war makes countries poorer and slows down progress. This makes life difficult for everyone, especially in poor countries.
</p><p>
In conclusion, war brings destruction, suffering, and loss to people and nations. It ends lives, breaks families, and causes deep pain that lasts for many years. That is why it is important for countries to work for peace and solve their problems through talks, not fighting. Peace is the only way to ensure a happy and safe life for all.</p>
