        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What can be the expectations of the parents from their offspring at the old age?</p>
        <p>= When parents grow old, they don't ask for expensive gifts or big surprises. What they really want is love, respect, and time from their children. After working hard all their lives to raise us, they hope that we won't forget them when they get old.
</p><p>
Old age can be lonely. Many parents feel left out because their children are busy with school, work, or friends. They don't want to feel like a burden. They just want someone to sit with them, talk to them, and listen to what they have to say.
</p><p>
Sometimes, they also want to feel useful. Maybe they want to help in small ways or share advice. Including them in family talks or asking for their opinion makes them feel happy and respected.
</p><p>
Every parent is different, but most of them want to feel loved, remembered, and cared for. A simple hug, a smile, or even asking “How are you today?” can mean a lot to them.
</p><p>
So, we should always try our best to be kind to our parents and give them the care they truly deserve.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Some children who live in a distance tend to be indifferent to the feelings of their parents. Why do you think they are like that? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= These days, many children live far away from their parents because of studies, jobs, or business. They move to cities or even other countries to achieve their goals. At first, they may stay in touch, but slowly their busy life takes over. They get so involved in their work and personal life that they forget to call or visit their parents regularly.
</p><p>
As time passes, the bond between parents and children becomes weaker. Some children start thinking that success, money, and career are more important than spending time with their parents. This attitude hurts the parents, especially in their old age when they need love and support the most.
</p><p>
Also, after getting married and starting their own family, some children give more importance to their wife and kids. They may not mean to ignore their parents, but it happens because of their busy and distracted lives. As a result, the parents feel lonely, forgotten, and unhappy.
</p><p>
It's important to understand that parents don't need much just a little love, care, and attention. Even a small call or visit can make a big difference in their lives. We should not forget the sacrifices they made for us when we were young.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. A mother's love is everlasting and indispensable. Justify.</p>
        <p>= A mother's love is something that never fades. It starts even before we are born and stays with us for our whole life. From the time she carries us in her womb to when we grow up, her love never changes. It is full of care, kindness, and sacrifice.</p>
        <p>After birth, a child sees the mother as their first friend and protector. She feeds us, comforts us, teaches us, and always makes sure we are safe and happy. Mothers never ask for anything in return. They are always thinking about what is best for us, even when we don't notice it.</p>
        <p>A mother plays many roles in a child's life. She is a teacher when she helps with homework, a nurse when we are sick, and a friend when we need someone to talk to. She understands our needs without us even saying anything. She stays up all night if we are sick and celebrates every little achievement with joy.</p>
        <p>Many times, we forget to appreciate our mothers. We take their love for granted. But the truth is, without a mother's love, life feels empty. She is a gift from God that we should love and respect every day.</p>
        <p>In the end, no matter how old we get, we always need our mother. Her love is the strongest and purest form of love, and it truly is everlasting and indispensable.</p>
