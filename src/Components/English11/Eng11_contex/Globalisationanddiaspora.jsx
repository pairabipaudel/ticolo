        <h3>Comprehension</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. Why did millions of Palestinians leave their country?</p>
        <p>= Millions of Palestinians left their country because they were denied basic human rights and hoped to find a better life with more opportunities and safety elsewhere.</p>
        <p>b. How is the global culture formed? Is cultural identity possible even in the global culture? Justify.</p>
        <p>= Global culture is formed mainly by young people who have grown up with new technologies like the internet and social media. These tools help people from different parts of the world connect and share ideas, creating a culture that is common to many countries.

Yes, cultural identity is still possible even in a global culture. While people share many things globally, they also care deeply about their own traditions and uniqueness. Globalization makes people more aware of their own culture and helps them feel proud of it. So, even in a global world, people can keep their cultural identity and traditions alive.</p>
        <p>c. Why can moving from one side of the world to the other be an economic challenge for newcomers?</p>
        <p>= Moving to a new country far away can be hard for newcomers because it takes time to adjust. They need to learn a new language, understand the new culture, and find jobs. All these steps can make it difficult to earn money and support themselves at first.</p>
        <p>d. How can immigrants foster economy at different magnitudes of scale in their new homes?</p>
        <p>= Immigrants can help the economy in many ways in their new countries. They can start their own businesses, which creates jobs and brings new ideas. They can also work in different industries, contribute skills, and pay taxes. All these activities help grow the economy on small and large scales.</p>
        <p>e. Can immigrants fully integrate in the new societies? Give reasons.</p>
        <p>= No, immigrants often cannot fully integrate into new societies because sometimes the local people and society do not welcome them completely. There can be language barriers, cultural differences, and even discrimination that make it hard for immigrants to feel fully accepted and become a complete part of the community.</p>
        <p>f. Mention any two benefits of integrating into a new society for the immigrants.</p>
        <p>= Any two benefits of integrating into a new society for the immigrants are:</p>
        <p>1. Immigrants get equal chances to learn new things, take part in activities, and feel confident about themselves.</p>
        <p>2. The country where they live can grow stronger and richer because immigrants contribute to the economy.</p>
        <p>g. Why should the immigrants run in concordance with global culture?</p>
        <p>= Immigrants should follow global culture because staying isolated or different can cause more problems and make it harder for them to succeed. Joining in with the global culture helps them fit in better and have more opportunities.</p>

      <div>
        <h3>Critical Thinking</h3>
        <p>a. Do you think that the local is globalized and the global is localized? Can there be the global culture as well? Give examples.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I think the local is becoming global, and the global is becoming local. This means that local things like food, clothes, music, and traditions are now known and used around the world. For example, momo from Nepal is enjoyed in other countries too. At the same time, global things like fast food, fashion, and English language are used in local places every day. This is how the global becomes part of the local culture.

There can also be something called global culture. This means people from different countries share similar things like pop music, movies, sports, and even social media trends. For example, people all over the world watch the FIFA World Cup or listen to K-pop music. So, even though we live in different countries, we are starting to enjoy and do many of the same things. This shows that local is becoming global, and global is becoming local.

      <div>
        <p>b. What is globalization? Discuss the effects of globalization on traditional cultures.</p>
        <p>= Globalization means the world is becoming more connected. People, goods, money, ideas, and even culture now move more easily from one country to another. Because of this, we can buy products from other countries, watch international movies, use foreign apps, and even eat food from different parts of the world.

Globalization affects traditional cultures in both good and bad ways. For example, in the past, people in villages used to celebrate local festivals, use bullock carts, and write letters. But now, because of development and technology, people use tractors, mobile phones, and live in cities. Old ways of life are slowly changing. Families used to sit together and watch TV, but now everyone has their own phone or screen.

Even though globalization brings new habits and ways of living, it doesn't mean all traditional culture disappears. Some customs, values, and traditions still remain strong. So, globalization changes many parts of our culture, but not everything. It's a mix of keeping the old and learning the new.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>c. Discuss the impacts of globalization on the process and progress of education in Nepal.</p>
        <p>= Globalization has had a big impact on education in Nepal. It has helped improve the quality of education by introducing better teaching methods and learning systems from around the world. Because of globalization, new ways of learning like online classes and e-learning have become popular, especially after the internet became widely used.

Some foreign universities have also opened in Nepal, giving students more choices for higher education. These universities and foreign support have helped improve school buildings, libraries, and other facilities. Globalization has also helped students learn more about the world and different cultures, which makes them more open-minded.

It has made people more aware of human rights and how governments should work. Many people have learned from international ideas and used them to demand better education and fairness.

But not everyone has benefitted equally. Rich people and those in cities have better access to good schools and technology, while poor and rural areas are still behind. So, Nepal needs to make sure that all students, no matter where they live or how rich they are, can enjoy the benefits of globalization in education.</p>

        <strong>Tihar Festival Celebrated with Great Enthusiasm in Pokhara
By Staff Reporter
Pokhara, July 2

The five-day-long Tihar festival was celebrated with much joy, music, and lights in Pokhara this week. Locals gathered to observe the cultural traditions, making the entire city vibrant and lively.

Beginning with Kaag Tihar and followed by Kukur Tihar, residents honored crows and dogs for their symbolic connection to life and loyalty. On Gai Tihar and Laxmi Puja, homes were decorated with oil lamps, candles, and colorful lights. People created rangolis at their doorsteps and offered prayers to Goddess Laxmi, the goddess of wealth, for blessings and prosperity.

The most exciting part of the festival was the Deusi-Bhailo performances. Groups of children and youths went from house to house singing traditional songs. In return, they received money, sweets, and blessings. “It's a beautiful tradition that brings the community closer,” said Maya Sharma, a local resident.

On the final day, Bhai Tika was celebrated with deep emotions and strong family bonding. Sisters offered tika, garlands, and special food to their brothers, wishing them long life and happiness. In return, brothers gave gifts and promises of protection.

Local markets remained busy throughout the week as people bought decorative items, sweets, and flowers. Business owners reported high sales and increased footfall. “We are very happy with the response this year. Sales doubled compared to last year,” said Rajendra Poudel, a local flower vendor.

The police department and community volunteers ensured smooth celebrations by managing traffic and maintaining peace. No major incidents were reported during the festival.

Tihar in Pokhara not only lit up homes and hearts but also strengthened family ties and community harmony.</strong>
