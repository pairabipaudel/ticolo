        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In this poem-like speech, Shakespeare tells us that life is like a big play, and we are all actors. We come into the world (the stage) when we are born, play different roles as we grow, and then leave the stage when we die. Each person plays seven roles during their life.

First, we are babies, helpless and always crying in someone's arms. Then we become schoolchildren, who don't like going to school and walk slowly with sleepy faces. After that, we grow into young lovers, full of feelings, dreaming about love, and writing poems for the person we love.

As we get older, we turn into brave soldiers. At this stage, people are full of energy and ready to fight or take risks to earn respect or fame. Then comes the judge, a grown and wise person who is respected, speaks wisely, and lives a more settled life.

Later in life, we enter old age. Our body becomes weak, our voice changes, and we start losing strength. We may wear glasses and walk slowly. And finally, we reach the last stage, where we become like a child again—forgetful, toothless, and needing help from others for everything.

Shakespeare wants us to understand that life moves in a full circle. We start helpless and end helpless. Life is not always what it seems—it's like a drama where people come, act their parts, and then leave. Through this idea, he shows how short and changing human life is.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. Why does the poet compare the world with a stage?</p>
        <p>= The poet compares the world to a stage because he believes that all men and women are like actors. Just like actors play different roles in a play, people also play different roles in life as they grow. By “stage,” the poet means the world, and by “roles,” he means the different stages of human life.</p>
        <p>b. What is the first stage in a human's life? In what sense can it be a troubling stage?</p>
        <p>= The first stage in a human's life is childhood, especially when a person is a baby. This stage can be troubling because the baby is fully dependent on others. The baby cries a lot, can't speak, and might even vomit while being held. The child needs constant care and attention from parents or caregivers.</p>
        <p>c. Describe the second stage of life based on the poem.</p>
        <p>= The second stage of life is boyhood. In this stage, the person is a school-going child. He doesn't enjoy school and always complains about going. His face is fresh like the bright morning, but he walks very slowly, like a snail, carrying his school bag. This shows that he goes to school unwillingly.</p>
        <p>d. Why is the last stage called second childhood?</p>
        <p>= The last stage is called second childhood because, in this stage, a person becomes weak and helpless like a small child. He starts to lose his senses like sight, hearing, taste, and memory and needs help from others for everything. Just like in childhood, he cannot take care of himself.</p>
        <p>e. In what sense are we the players in the world stage?</p>
        <p>= We are the players on the world stage because, like actors in a play, we enter the stage when we are born and leave it when we die. During our life, we play different roles, just like actors perform different parts in a theater.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Explain the following lines:</p>
        <p>All the world's a stage,
And all the men and women merely players</p>
<p>= In these lines, Shakespeare compares the world to a stage where everyone acts like actors. He means that life is like a play, and people come and go just like actors entering and leaving a stage. From the moment we are born, we play different parts or roles in life, facing different experiences and challenges. Eventually, like actors finishing their scenes, we leave the world when we die. This shows how life is temporary and made up of different stages, just like a performance.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Explain the following lines briefly with Reference to the context.</p>
        <p>They have their exits and their entrances;
And one man in his time plays many parts,</p>
<p>= These lines are from Shakespeare's poem “All the World's a Stage.” Here, the poet compares people's lives to actors on a stage. Just like actors come onto the stage (entrances) and leave it (exits), people enter the world through birth and leave it through death.

During life, each person plays many different roles or parts, just like actors perform different characters in a play. When a person finishes playing their roles, they leave the “stage” of life. Shakespeare wants us to understand that human life is like a play where everyone has a role to act in different stages of life.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Read the given lines and answer the questions that follow.</p>
        <p>Then the whining schoolboy, with his satchel
And shining morning face, creeping like snail
Unwillingly to school.</p>
<p>i. Which stage of life is being referred to here by the poet?</p>
<p>= The poet is talking about the childhood stage, especially when the boy goes to school.</p>
<p>ii. Which figure of speech has been employed in the second line?</p>
<p>= The figure of speech used is a simile, where the boy is compared to a snail using the word "like."</p>
<p>iii. Who is compared to the snail?</p>
<p>= The schoolboy is compared to the snail.</p>
<p>iv. Does the boy go to the school willingly?</p>
<p>= No, the boy goes to school unwillingly. His slow and reluctant movement is compared to a snail creeping slowly.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>d. Simile and metaphor are the two major poetic devices used in this poem. Explain citing examples of each.</p>
        <p>= In the poem "A Red, Red Rose" by Robert Burns, the poet uses both simile and metaphor to express deep and everlasting love. These poetic devices help make the feelings more vivid and emotional.</p>
        <p>The examples of simile and metaphor of this poem are as follows:</p>
        <p>a. "All the world's a stage" - Metaphor</p>
        <p>b. "And all the men and women merely players" - Metaphor</p>
        <p>c. "And shining morning face, creeping like a snail" - Simile</p>
        <p>d. "Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the pard," - Simile</p>
        <p>e. "Seeking the bubble reputation" - Metaphor</p>
        <p>f. "His youthful hose, well sav'd, a world too wide" - Metaphor.</p>
        <p>g. "and his big manly voice, Turning again toward childish treble" - Metaphor.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>e. Which style does the poet use to express his emotions about how he thinks that the world is a stage and all the people living in it are mere players?</p>
        <p>= The poet uses a narrative style written in blank verse, which means the poem has a regular rhythm but no rhyme. This style allows him to express his deep thoughts in a natural and flowing way. He compares the world to a stage and all people to actors who play different roles throughout their lives. The poem describes seven stages of human life, showing how people change from infancy to old age. Through this style, the poet helps readers understand the reality of life and its different phases.</p>

      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>f. What is the theme of this poem?</p>
        <p>= In the poem “All the world's a stage,” William Shakespeare talks about how human life is like a play. He says that the world is a stage, and all people are just actors. They come onto the stage (are born), play their roles (live life), and then leave the stage (die). This idea is the main theme of the poem, that life has different parts, and people act differently at each part.

Shakespeare explains that every person goes through seven stages of life. These are: infant, schoolboy, lover, soldier, judge, old man, and finally a very weak stage that is like being a baby again. Each stage has its own actions, behavior, and problems. For example, the schoolboy is lazy, the lover writes poems, the soldier is brave but proud, and the judge is wise and serious. In the last stage, a person becomes old, weak, forgetful, and needs help again, just like a small child.

The poem also talks about aging, the passing of time, and how nothing stays the same. No matter how powerful or successful someone becomes, they cannot escape growing old and dying. Shakespeare wants us to think about how life changes and how we do not have full control over what happens to us. We are all just like actors, playing a role written for us by life or fate.

So, the main theme of the poem is the journey of human life, and how everyone must pass through different stages before reaching the end.

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Describe the various stages of human life picturised in the poem "All the world's a stage."</p>
        <p>= In the poem “All the World's a Stage,” William Shakespeare compares the world to a stage and people to actors. He says that every person plays different roles in life, passing through seven stages from birth to death.

1. Infancy (First Stage):
In the first stage, the person is a baby. He is helpless and depends on his mother. He cries a lot and often vomits. This stage shows how weak and dependent human life begins.

2. Schoolboy (Second Stage):
In the second stage, he becomes a school-going child. He carries his bag and goes to school unwillingly, walking slowly like a snail. He doesn't enjoy studying and shows laziness.

3. Lover (Third Stage):
In this stage, the young man falls in love. He writes poems and sings songs for his beloved. He becomes emotional and full of dreams, always thinking about his love.

4. Soldier (Fourth Stage):
Here, he becomes brave and ambitious. He is quick to argue and ready to fight for his country. He seeks honor and fame and becomes very concerned about his reputation.

5. Justice (Fifth Stage):
In the fifth stage, he becomes a judge or a wise man. He is mature, full of advice, and experienced. He enjoys a comfortable life and speaks with authority and seriousness.

6. Old Age (Sixth Stage):
In this stage, he starts growing old. He becomes thin, wears loose clothes, and uses glasses. His strong voice turns into a weak, high-pitched tone. He slowly begins to lose his strength and energy.

7. Second Childhood (Seventh Stage):
This is the final stage of life. The person becomes like a child again — forgetful, weak, and completely dependent on others. He loses his senses like sight, hearing, and taste. At the end, he leaves the stage of life — he dies.

In this poem, Shakespeare presents a realistic and thoughtful picture of human life, showing how we all go through these stages before exiting the world, just like actors finishing a play.

      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Is Shakespeare's comparison of human life with a drama stage apt? How?
</p>
<p>= Yes, Shakespeare's comparison of human life to a drama stage is very accurate and meaningful. In his poem “All the World's a Stage,” he says that the world is like a stage, and all people—men and women—are like actors. They come into the world (like actors entering the stage), play different roles throughout their lives, and then leave the world (like actors exiting the stage).

This idea makes a lot of sense when we look at real life. Every person is born, grows up, changes with time, takes on new responsibilities, and then grows old and dies. Just like actors in a play, we all go through different "roles" at different times in our lives. For example, we first play the role of a child, then a student, a lover, a worker or soldier, a wise adult, and finally an old person who becomes weak and helpless again—almost like a child.

This comparison is not only poetic, but also something we can see around us every day. Our moods, actions, behavior, and duties keep changing as we grow older, just like an actor's role in a play. In fact, even if Shakespeare hadn't written this, we could still notice the same pattern by watching how people live their lives.

Shakespeare's idea also reminds us that life is temporary, and we are all just here for a short time to play our part. No one stays forever, and no one plays just one role. This makes his comparison feel very real and relatable.

So, yes Shakespeare's comparison of human life to a drama stage is very apt because it matches the way human life truly works. We are all like actors in the big play of life, entering, performing, and then finally exiting when our part is over.
