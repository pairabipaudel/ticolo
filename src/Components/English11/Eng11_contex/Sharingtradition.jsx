        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In the essay Sharing Tradition, Frank LaPena talks about the importance of oral tradition in keeping culture and history alive. Oral tradition means passing down stories, customs, values, and knowledge by speaking, from elders to younger generations. LaPena explains that this way of sharing is very important because it helps preserve the identity of a community or group.

He points out some problems that make it hard to keep oral traditions today. For example, many young people are not interested in listening to elders, and modern technology and changes in life make it difficult to follow old customs. Sometimes, the information shared is not true or complete, which can cause confusion.

LaPena believes it is the responsibility of both elders and young people to protect and share these traditions. Elders should pass on the stories carefully, and young people should listen and learn. This way, the culture and values of a community can continue to live and grow, even in a changing world.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. According to LaPena, what is the importance of the oral tradition? To what extent do you agree with his opinions and why?</p>
        <p>= Frank LaPena, the writer of this essay, believes that oral tradition is very important. He says that the traditions and stories shared by our elders should be passed down orally from one generation to the next. This helps to keep our culture alive and protect our cultural heritage.

I agree with his opinion because oral tradition helps young people learn about how their ancestors lived, their social and cultural environment, and family history. It connects us to our roots and helps us understand who we are. Our culture is part of our identity, and oral tradition is a simple but powerful way to preserve that identity and keep it alive for the future.</p>
<p>b. Who preserve and pass on the oral tradition?</p>
<p>= Oral tradition is a way people share knowledge, culture, stories, and ideas by speaking, from one generation to the next. It is the responsibility of everyone, especially the elders and experienced people in the community, to preserve and pass on these traditions. They have lived through these customs and know their importance, so they teach and share them with younger generations to keep the culture alive.</p>
<p>c. What is the danger of not passing on information from generation to generation?</p>
<p>= If information is not passed from one generation to the next, our culture and traditions will be lost. Things like festivals, religions, and customs might disappear. We could forget our identity and the values that make us who we are. Without passing on this knowledge, future generations won't understand or appreciate their roots.</p>
<p>d. What is the difference between oral tradition and literary tradition?</p>
<p>= The difference between oral tradition and literary tradition is in how information is passed on. Oral tradition shares culture, stories, and values by speaking and listening, passed from one generation to the next by word of mouth. Literary tradition, on the other hand, passes information through writing, books, and other written materials.</p>
<p>e. How does LaPena establish a relationship between art and the oral tradition?</p>
<p>= LaPena shows that both art and oral tradition are ways to communicate and share ideas. He explains that oral tradition inspires art because the stories, characters, and messages we hear help artists imagine what to create. The oral tradition influences how artists think about designs, colors, and shapes in their work. So, oral tradition is like a source of creativity for art.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>a. LaPena states that the oral tradition helps maintain the values of a culture. If you believe that the oral tradition is important, how would you maintain it?</p>
        <p>= I agree that oral tradition is important because it helps keep the values of our culture alive. If I want to maintain it, I would do these things:

1. I would record interviews with old people and save the tapes and written copies so their stories don't get lost.

2. I would listen carefully and pay attention when elders share their knowledge and experiences.

3. I might start a project to protect and promote our oral traditions.

4. I would organize street plays or dramas that show stories and traditions from our culture.

5. When I grow old, I would share what I have learned about oral tradition with the younger generation, so they can keep it alive too.</p>

        <p>b. “Not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.” Explain this statement with reference to the essay.</p>
        <p>= Yes, it is true that not everyone can fulfill the roles of elders. Elders are usually older people who have lived for many years. But just being old doesn't mean someone can be a good elder.

To be a real elder, a person should know a lot about the traditions and culture from the past. Some elders may have followed and learned their traditions since they were young, but some may not have. Those who did not follow or learn the traditions may not know much about them.

So, only those elders who really understand and respect the traditions can pass on the right knowledge to the next generation. If an elder doesn't know much about the traditions, they cannot teach others properly.

That's why the essay says, “not everyone is capable of fulfilling the roles of the elders.”</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>c. What is the controlling idea or thesis of this essay?</p>
        <p>= The main idea of this essay is that we should protect and preserve our traditions. Whatever traditions we follow now should be saved and passed on to future generations. The young people in the next generations should also know about these traditions and keep practicing them.

Right now, many people have already forgotten some traditions, and some have even disappeared. This essay was written to remind us about the importance of keeping our culture alive by preserving our traditions.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>d. How do topic sentences guide the reader through the essay? What would be lost without them?</p>
        <p>= Topic sentences help the reader understand what each paragraph is about. They connect to the main idea or thesis of the essay and tell the reader what to expect in the paragraph. Every sentence in the paragraph should relate to the topic sentence.

A good topic sentence shows the main point and the writer's opinion, so the reader can follow the writer's ideas easily.

If there were no topic sentences, the paragraphs would be confusing because the main point would not be clear. Without topic sentences, the reader would have a hard time understanding the main ideas or the message of the essay.</p>

      <div>
        <p>e. What are the four major problems developed by LaPena with regard to maintaining the oral tradition. How are they used to structure the essay?</p>
        <p>= LaPena talks about four big problems in keeping oral tradition alive:

1. Some elders have special and important roles in protecting traditions, and it is hard to replace them when they are gone.

2. Young people are not very interested in listening to or learning from the elders.

3. It is difficult to keep traditions during changing times because new technology and modern life can destroy old values.

4. There is no true sharing between generations. Sometimes, modern research collects wrong information about traditions, and it is hard to fix these mistakes later.

These four problems are used to organize the essay. LaPena explains each problem one by one to show why it is difficult to keep oral tradition alive today.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p>a. Write a paragraph or two explaining your attitude toward the oral tradition of passing along information.</p>
        <p>= Oral tradition is a very important way for people to keep their culture and values alive. It is also a kind of art because it tells stories and shares ideas from our traditions. Both elders and young people have important roles in protecting and passing on this knowledge from one generation to the next.

I believe oral tradition helps us learn about the culture, skills, and knowledge of our ancestors. It gives the younger generation a chance to understand their past and realize that culture is a big part of who we are. My attitude toward oral tradition is very positive because if we lose our culture, we lose our identity. Without our culture and traditions, we might feel lost and confused about who we really are. That is why it is very important to protect and pass on oral traditions so they can continue to live in the future.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>b. Our culture is our identity. Write a few paragraphs explaining how you intend to preserve your culture, values and norms.</p>
        <p>= It is true that our culture shows who we really are. Our traditions and values shape our identity. If we lose our culture, we lose a part of ourselves. That’s why it is our duty to protect and keep our culture, values, and norms alive.

I plan to preserve my culture by doing these things:

1. Celebrating all the important ceremonies and festivals of my culture.

2. Teaching others about how important our culture and values are.

3. Supporting cultural events and programs in my community.

4. Starting or joining groups that work to protect our cultural heritage.

5. Sharing stories and information about our traditions with friends and family.

In conclusion, preserving culture is very important because it helps people feel connected and proud of where they come from. Our ancestors passed down many traditions to us, but today, busy lives and new changes make it harder to keep those traditions alive. To save our culture, we need to protect and share it with others. This way, future generations will know their roots and keep our culture alive.</p>
