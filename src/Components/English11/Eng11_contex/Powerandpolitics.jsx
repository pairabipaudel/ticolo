        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What can be the qualities of a great leader? Can a great leader remain in power for long in a country? Discuss.</p>
        <p>= A great leader is someone who guides people in the right direction and helps them achieve common goals. Good leadership is very important for the success of any group, organization, or country. Without a strong leader, it is hard to make progress or solve problems. A great leader must have some important qualities.
          </p><p>
First, confidence is very important. A leader must believe in themselves and their decisions. If a leader is not confident, people will not follow them. A great leader should also be honest and trustworthy. If people do not trust their leader, they will not support them. Another important quality is good communication. A leader must be able to share ideas clearly and listen to others. Decision-making is also a key skill. A good leader must make smart and fair decisions that help everyone.
</p><p>
In addition, a great leader must be inspiring. They should encourage people and give them hope, even during difficult times. Lastly, creativity and new ideas are important too. A leader must think of better ways to solve problems and help their country grow.
</p><p>
In conclusion, a great leader is confident, honest, inspiring, a good communicator, a smart decision-maker, and creative. If a leader has all these qualities, people will respect and support them. Such a leader can remain in power for a long time because they bring progress, peace, and development to the country.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. The 16th president of the USA, Abraham Lincoln said democracy is government of the people for the people and by the people. Do you think it is perfectly applicable in the present context of Nepal? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Abraham Lincoln said that democracy means a government that is run by the people, works for the people, and is chosen by the people. It sounds like a fair and wonderful system. But in the case of Nepal, this idea of democracy doesn't fully match with what is happening today.
</p><p>
Nepal is supposed to be a democratic country, where everyone's voice matters. Our Constitution says that all people should be treated equally and should have the power to make decisions. But in real life, this doesn't happen. Many government offices don't work properly unless people pay bribes. The leaders and workers in the government often care more about their own benefit than the needs of the public. Instead of being honest and fair, some government employees and politicians help their own family and friends first. This is called corruption, and it is a big problem in Nepal.
</p><p>
Because of this, many people in Nepal feel disappointed. They don't trust the leaders anymore because they haven't seen real changes or development. For democracy to truly work in Nepal, everyone including government leaders, workers, and citizens must be honest, responsible, and fair. Only then can we have the kind of democracy that Abraham Lincoln talked about.</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Write an essay on Power and Politics in about 500 words.</p>
        <strong>Power and Politics</strong>
        <p>Power and politics are two important parts of our daily life. Whether we realize it or not, they affect everything from families and schools to governments and countries. Understanding what power and politics mean can help us see how decisions are made and how people influence each other.
</p><p>
Power is the ability to make things happen. It means having control or influence over others. For example, parents have power in a family because they make rules and decisions. In school, teachers have power because they guide students and decide on grades. In a country, leaders have power to make laws and keep the society running smoothly. Power is not always about being bossy or strict. It can also be used to help people and bring positive changes.
</p><p>
Politics is the way people use power. It is about how people compete, cooperate, and negotiate to make decisions. Politics is not only about government or politicians. It happens everywhere at home, in school, and even among friends. For example, when students decide who will be the class monitor, they take part in politics. In government, politics is about making laws, running the country, and solving problems that affect everyone.
</p><p>
Power and politics can be good or bad depending on how they are used. When leaders use power responsibly and fairly, they help the country grow and people live better lives. Good politics means listening to others, respecting different opinions, and working together for the common good. For example, when leaders involve citizens in decisions and respect their rights, the country becomes peaceful and strong.
</p><p>
However, power and politics can also cause problems. Sometimes, people want power only for themselves. They may use unfair ways like cheating, lying, or bullying to get power. This can create corruption, injustice, and violence. For example, a politician might promise things just to win votes but then forget about the people after winning. Such misuse of power causes loss of trust and makes society weak.
</p><p>
In many countries, including Nepal, power and politics have been challenging. Sometimes, leaders fight for power without thinking about the people's needs. Corruption and selfishness slow down progress and cause inequality. Ordinary people feel powerless and lose faith in their leaders. This is why it is important for citizens to be aware and active in politics. When people vote wisely, speak up against injustice, and participate in social activities, they help keep the system fair.
</p><p>
Power and politics are part of life, and we all play a role in them. As young people, we can learn about democracy, rights, and responsibilities. We can practice fairness and respect in our daily life. When we grow up, we can become good leaders who use power wisely and take part in politics honestly. This way, we can build a better society for everyone.
</p><p>
In conclusion, power gives people the ability to influence others, and politics is how that power is used. Both can bring good or bad results depending on the people involved. It is important to use power fairly and take part in politics with honesty and respect. Only then can we create a peaceful and prosperous society.

        <p className='question'>b. Write a couple of paragraphs about a national hero who fought bravely in the Anglo-Nepal War.</p>
        <p>Balbhadra Kunwar is one of the most famous heroes of Nepal who fought bravely in the Anglo-Nepal War. He was a strong and smart leader who defended Nepal against the British army. When the British soldiers tried to enter the Kathmandu Valley, Balbhadra was in charge of protecting a fort called Nalapani. Even though his army was much smaller and had fewer weapons, he and his soldiers fought very hard and did not give up easily.
          </p><p>
Balbhadra Kunwar's courage and leadership encouraged his soldiers to keep fighting, even when they were running out of food and water. They never surrendered because they loved their country and wanted to protect it. Although the fort was taken by the British in the end, Balbhadra's brave defense made him a symbol of patriotism for all Nepalese people. His story teaches us to be brave and loyal to our nation.
