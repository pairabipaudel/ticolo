      <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
      <p className='question'>a. The Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are the creation of the autocratic rulers. Present your view for or against this statement.</p>
      <p>= I agree that the Great Wall of China and the Taj Mahal were created by autocratic rulers. The Great Wall of China was constructed primarily to protect the northern borders of the Chinese empire from enemy invasions. It is a massive structure made up of multiple walls built over centuries, with the earliest walls dating back to the 7th century BC. Such a huge project could not have been completed without the power of an autocratic ruler. People were often forced into labor under harsh punishments if they disobeyed orders. Those who contributed greatly were rewarded, but many were treated as slaves and suffered greatly during the construction.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the Taj Mahal was built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. It is said that Shah Jahan ruled with an iron fist, reportedly harming the artists to ensure that the monument would remain unique. The construction took 20 years and involved around 20,000 workers. While many admire the beauty of the Taj Mahal, the harsh realities behind its construction often go unnoticed.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, both the Great Wall and the Taj Mahal are monumental creations made possible by the absolute power and control of autocratic rulers, who used their authority to mobilize resources and people, often at great human cost.</p>

      <p className='question'>b. How do you describe the pros and cons of feudalism?</p>
      <p>= Feudalism was a social and economic system that dominated medieval Europe, where land was exchanged for service and protection. Under this system, peasants and knights served nobles or lords, who in turn provided land and security.</p>
      <p>One of the main advantages of feudalism was that it brought stability during a chaotic time. After the fall of the Roman Empire, Europe faced constant invasions and conflicts. Feudalism created a structured society where lords protected their lands and people from outside threats. It also encouraged loyalty and a sense of duty among knights and peasants, promoting bravery and honor. The system helped organize society and maintain order in the absence of a strong central government.</p>
      <p>However, feudalism had significant drawbacks. It reinforced social inequality by dividing people into strict classes, where the nobles had most of the power and wealth while peasants lived in hardship. Many peasants, known as serfs, were bound to the land and could not leave without their lord's permission. This lack of freedom and harsh control limited their opportunities and kept them dependent. Additionally, the system allowed lords to exploit their power, sometimes treating peasants unfairly without consequences.</p>
      <p>In summary, while feudalism provided protection and social order during difficult times, it also created divisions and restricted the freedom of many people, making life hard for the lower classes.</p>

        <p className='question'>a. Write an email to your friend living abroad stating the contributions of Prithvi Narayan Shah in the unification of Nepal.</p>
        <p>To: mansi03@gmail.com</p>
        <p>
From: ganesh18@gmail.com</p><p>
Subject: The Role of Prithvi Narayan Shah in Unifying Nepal
</p><p>
Dear Mansi,
</p><p>
I hope you are doing well. I wanted to share some important insights about Prithvi Narayan Shah and his crucial role in unifying Nepal, following our recent chat about Nepal's history.
</p><p>
Prithvi Narayan Shah was a great leader who ended the continuous fighting among the small kingdoms such as Kathmandu, Lalitpur, Bhaktapur, and Gorkha. Before his time, these states were divided and vulnerable to outside invasions. Shah's vision and courage brought these separate kingdoms together to form a single, united Nepal.
</p><p>
More than just a conqueror, he worked hard to create a sense of unity and patriotism among the people. His leadership protected Nepal from foreign domination and laid the groundwork for the country's independence. Unlike many rulers who ruled for their own benefit, Shah's focus was on the strength and welfare of the entire nation.
</p><p>
In summary, Prithvi Narayan Shah's contributions helped shape Nepal into the proud and independent country we know today. His legacy continues to inspire us all.
</p><p>
Looking forward for your thoughts!
</p><p>
Best wishes,
</p><p>
Ganesh</p>
