        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. “Down the rabbit hole” is a sort of writing called fantasy. On the basis of your reading of the story point out some special elements of this kind of writing?</p>
        <p>= Fantasy refers to stories that involve imagination and things that are not real. Unlike stories based on facts, fantasy stories include events and characters that do not follow the rules of the real world. They often have magical or supernatural elements, such as magic spells, talking animals, or magical creatures.
</p><p>
Fantasy stories are usually set in the past, often in times like the medieval era, where there are castles, knights, kings, and magical swords. The characters live in worlds where technology is limited, but magic exists and helps them.
</p><p>
The idea of fantasy has been around for many centuries, inspired by myths, legends, and fairy tales. However, modern fantasy stories started to develop during the Victorian era, when writers began to create their own unique magical worlds instead of just retelling old stories.
</p><p>
In summary, fantasy writing takes readers to imaginative places with magic, strange creatures, and adventures beyond the real world.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Is it good to imagine of things which are not possible to achieve in reality? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Imagination is the ability to create pictures and ideas in our mind that we don't see with our five senses. It helps us dream and think about things we want, even if they are not real yet.
    </p><p>
Many people use their imagination to picture a better life or to think about what might happen in the future. When we practice using our imagination, it helps us become more creative. This means we can have better ideas and understand what we really want in life.
</p><p>
Imagination also helps us build confidence and can reduce stress, which makes us feel healthier and happier. It clears our minds from confusing thoughts and helps us focus.
</p><p>
By imagining, we can explore different possibilities and shape the future we want. So, even if some things seem impossible now, imagining them is good because it helps us grow, plan, and sometimes even make those dreams come true.

      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. Do you talk to yourself when you are in a trouble? If yes, how does it help you?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I do talk to myself when I am in trouble. Actually, I talk to myself almost every day! I'm not exactly sure how long I have been doing it, but I know I've been doing it for many years, and I actually like it.
</p><p>
Talking to myself helps me in many ways. I can say things to myself that I might not say to anyone else because no one understands me better than I do. I can say anything without being judged! I think self-talk is good because it doesn't take much effort like keeping a diary does. I usually talk to myself when I'm thinking about ideas, making decisions, or when I need some encouragement.
</p><p>
Self-talk makes me feel better because it feels like someone is there with me. It helps me make decisions easier and motivates me to do things I might be avoiding. In short, I use self-talk to manage strong feelings like anger, sadness, confusion, and stress, and to solve my personal problems.</p>

        <h3>Writing</h3>
        <p className='question'>Describe a strange dream that you have seen recently.</p>
        <p>= I was around 12 years old when I had a very strange and ridiculous dream. In the dream, I was in a room on a high floor of a tall building with five or six friends. We were looking out of the window and saw many other tall buildings around us. We were having fun, enjoying the view.
</p><p>
Suddenly, the ground started to shake. Then, in the distance, we saw a black figure moving toward us. As it got closer, we saw that it was a giant person, much taller than the buildings. This person was wearing all black clothes and a black mask. He started destroying every building he came near.
</p><p>
The giant figure came close to our building, and we all became very scared, running around the room. He destroyed the ceiling above us and the room above ours. Then he looked straight at me, and at that moment, I woke up.</p>
