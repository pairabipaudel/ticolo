        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p>a. How does the writer distinguish between a peaceful age and a heroic age?</p>
        <p>= The writer shows the difference between a peaceful age and a heroic age by comparing the two. He says that when he was born, it was a peaceful time with no big fights or wars. But later, in 1914, the First World War started, and that time became a heroic age. A heroic age is when people are called to fight, take risks, and show bravery. So, the peaceful age was calm and safe, while the heroic age was full of danger and courage.</p>

        <p>b. Why does the writer want more freedom of speech than most people?</p>
        <p>= The writer wants more freedom of speech than most people because he wants to speak openly about the problems in society. He believes it's important to tell the truth, even if it makes some people uncomfortable. For example, he wants to talk about how some medicines, newspapers, and drinks are not good or safe, and how people should know about these issues. He feels that freedom of speech helps him share these important messages honestly.</p>

        <p>c. According to the writer, what are the four general human needs?</p>
        <p>= According to the writer, the four general human needs are work, freedom of speech, health, and friendship. He believes that these are the basic things every person needs in life to live well. Work gives people purpose, freedom of speech allows them to express their thoughts, health keeps them strong, and friendship gives them emotional support and connection.</p>

        <p>d. What is the difference between desire and demand according to the writer?</p>
        <p>= According to the writer, the difference between desire and demand is that demand means the things we truly need to live, like food, clothes, and a place to live. These are basic needs. But desire means the things we want to have to make life more fun or comfortable, like a car, a garden, a swimming pool, or a beach nearby. So, demand is about what we need to survive, and desire is about what we want to enjoy life more.</p>

        <p>e. Why does the writer demand security?</p>
        <p>= The writer demands security because, without it, people cannot live a peaceful and happy life. He lived during a time when there were wars and a lot of trouble in the world, and many people's lives were in danger. Because of this, he felt that safety and protection were very important. Security helps people feel safe and gives them the chance to live without fear.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p>Explain the following lines with reference to the context:</p>
        <p>a. “The satisfaction of adventure is something much more solid than a thrill.”</p>
        <p>= In this line, the writer means that adventure gives a deeper and stronger feeling than just a short moment of excitement. A “thrill” is a quick feeling of fun or fear, like when you watch a scary movie or ride a roller coaster. It feels exciting for a short time but doesn't last. But real adventure gives you a feeling that stays with you. It makes you feel proud and happy for doing something brave or meaningful.

The writer shares his own story. He worked in a war in Madrid for six months. It was hard and dangerous, but it felt important. That was a real adventure. After the war, he read a book of poetry by Rimbaud just to enjoy and relax. It made him happy, but only for a short time. It didn't feel as strong or meaningful as the adventure he had during the war.

So, the writer is saying that adventure gives you more than just fun. It teaches you lessons, makes you stronger, and stays in your heart for a long time. It is more solid and real than just a thrill.</p>

      <div>
        <p>b. “I want the workers to see the fruit of their own work not in profits for others, but in their own and their friends' well-being.”</p>
        <p>= This means the writer wants the people who do the work to get the good things from their work, not just the bosses or owners. He thinks workers should get some of the money or rewards from what they make. He believes workers should be happy and healthy because of their work.

The writer likes the idea of sharing work and money fairly, called socialism. He wants workers to feel proud and enjoy their work, like long ago when people worked for their own families. He hopes industries will be fair and share money with the workers.

So, he wants work to help workers live better, not just make rich people richer.</p>

      <div>
        <p>c. Why do you think the essayist has taken reference from the ancient philosophers?</p>
        <p>= I think the essayist has mentioned ancient philosophers like Aristotle, Lord Blan, Mr. Dash, and Sir John Asterisk because he wants to support his ideas with well-known and respected thinkers. When we hear that famous people from history agree with a point, it becomes more believable and powerful. The essayist wants readers to trust his views about decent work and death, so he uses the opinions of these philosophers to make his argument stronger. By referring to them, he shows that his ideas are not new or just his own thoughts, but they have been thought about and accepted by smart people before. This helps the readers feel more confident in what the essayist is saying, and it encourages them to think more carefully about the importance of good work and how we face death.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>d. Discuss the essay in terms of its language, purpose, subject, point of view and mode of writing.</p>
        <p>= The language of the essay is simple and easy to understand. Haldane writes in a direct and strong way. Since he usually explains scientific ideas to common people, he knows how to make difficult topics simple. Even when he writes about something not related to science, he keeps his style clear, using short and powerful sentences. This helps any reader follow his thoughts easily.

At first, the essay seems personal, as if Haldane is just sharing his own experiences or opinions. But as the essay goes on, it becomes clear that he is making a bigger argument about society and politics. For example, when he talks about freedom, he is not just sharing his own wish but saying that freedom is something important for everyone in society. He believes society should be organized to give the most freedom to all people.

His point of view is like a social critic, someone who looks closely at how society works and suggests ideas to make it better. He shares general ideas about how a fair and civilized society should be, focusing on values like freedom and good work for everyone.</p>

        <h1>Reference beyond the text</h1>
        <p>a. What do you require from your life to be happy and satisfied?</p>
        <p>= To be truly happy and satisfied in life, I think I need several important things. First of all, good health is very important because without it, it is difficult to enjoy anything. Being physically and mentally healthy helps me to do my daily activities comfortably and stay positive. Secondly, having a stable job or work is necessary because it gives me a purpose and helps me earn money to support myself and my family. A job also gives a sense of achievement and confidence.

Friendship is another key part of happiness for me. Having true friends means having people to share my feelings, joys, and sorrows with. Friends support me during difficult times and make life more enjoyable. Freedom is also very important, the freedom to make my own choices and live my life in the way I want without unnecessary restrictions. Lastly, security is something I need to feel safe in my life. This includes financial security, safety in my home and community, and peace of mind about the future. When these things come together good health, meaningful work, caring friends, personal freedom, and security. I believe I can live a happy and satisfied life.</p>

        <p>c. Write an essay about your dream house.</p>
        <strong>My Dream House</strong>
        <p>Everyone has a special dream about the kind of house they want to live in. My dream house is small and simple, but it is full of peace and happiness. I want it to be a one-floor house because I like the idea of everything being on one level. This way, it will be easy to move around and feel comfortable.

The most important part of my dream house is the big open space around it. I want a large garden with lots of green grass where I can walk, play, and relax. In the garden, I will plant many trees like mango, guava, and orange trees so that I can enjoy fresh fruits. I also want colorful flowers all around to make the garden look beautiful and full of life.

Since I love nature and animals, I want my garden to be a home for many birds. I will put bird feeders and birdhouses so birds can come and live safely. I want to hear their sweet songs every morning because it makes me feel peaceful and happy. Living close to nature helps me feel calm and connected to the world.

Inside the house, I want simple and neat rooms. The living room will be cozy and warm, a place where my family and I can sit together and talk or watch TV. The kitchen will be clean and well-organized, where delicious meals can be made every day. My bedroom will be small but comfortable, with a big window so I can see the garden and the sky.

In short, my dream house is not about being big or expensive but about being a happy and peaceful home surrounded by nature. It is a place where I can enjoy life, relax, and feel close to the earth. This simple house with a beautiful garden and many birds will be my perfect home.</p>
