        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p>a. 'All children have the right to quality education. How can we ensure this right to every child? Discuss the role of the government and the parents to make sure that every child can attend school.'</p>
        <p>= Quality education is a fundamental need in the 21st century. To ensure this right for every child, the combined efforts of the government, parents, and schools are essential. These stakeholders must work together to create an environment where every child can access and benefit from meaningful learning.</p>
        <p>Role of the Government:</p>
        <p>1. The government can subsidize education by providing free or affordable schooling, especially for children from low-income families.
</p><p>
2. It should promote equality in education by ensuring that all public schools offer high-quality instruction and learning resources.
</p><p>
3. Teachers must be well-paid and professionally trained to stay motivated and deliver effective education.
</p><p>
4. The government should regularly update the curriculum to remove outdated content and align it with current needs and global standards.
</p><p>
5. Infrastructure development, such as safe classrooms, access to technology, and clean drinking water, should be prioritized.</p>
<p>Role of Parents:</p>
<p>1. Parents serve as role models, and their attitudes toward learning can inspire children to value education.
</p><p>
2. They should regularly communicate with their children about school experiences and provide emotional support.
</p><p>
3. Parents need to help children develop organized routines and time management skills, making sure there is dedicated time for study.
</p><p>
4. Creating a peaceful, encouraging, and resourceful learning environment at home is crucial for a child's academic growth.
</p><p>
5. They should also stay in touch with teachers and participate actively in their child's education.</p>

        <p className='question'>b.'Do you think that there is still discrimination between sons and daughters in terms of providing education in our country? What strategies do you suggest to overcome such discrimination against girls?'</p>
        <p>= Yes, discrimination between sons and daughters still exists in Nepal, especially when it comes to providing quality education. Although the government has made progress by offering free education in public schools, these schools often lack proper funding, infrastructure, and teaching quality compared to private institutions. In many families, daughters are sent to government schools while sons are enrolled in better private schools. This reflects deep-rooted gender inequality in our society.</p>
        <p>This discrimination is largely based on traditional beliefs. Many parents believe that daughters will eventually marry and leave the family, so they are less likely to invest in their education. Sons, on the other hand, are expected to support the family in the future, and are therefore given more opportunities. There is also a common belief that males are stronger—physically, mentally, and politically—so parents prioritize sons when it comes to education.</p>
        <p>Strategies to Overcome Discrimination Against Girls in Education:</p>
        <p>1. Gender bias should be eliminated through awareness programs that promote equality and the value of girls' education.</p>
        <p>2. Girls and women should be given opportunities to hold positions of power and achieve economic independence.</p>
        <p>3. Violence, harassment, and sexual assault against girls and women must be strictly addressed and prevented to create a safe learning environment.</p>
        <p>4. The deep-rooted societal preference for sons should be changed through education and community engagement.</p>
        <p>5. Families should invest in their daughters' education instead of spending money on dowries.</p>
        <p>Ensuring equal educational opportunities for both sons and daughters is essential for achieving true progress and prosperity in the country.</p>

         <p className='question'>c. 'A Chinese philosopher Confucius said, “If your plan is for one year, plant rice; if your plan is for ten years, plant trees; if your plan is for one hundred years, educate children.” What is the meaning of this saying? Elaborate this with examples.'</p>
         <p>= The meaning of this saying is that the time frame of your goals determines the kind of efforts you should make. If your plan is short-term, you focus on quick results, but if your plan is long-term, you invest in actions that take longer to bear fruit. The Chinese philosopher Confucius highlights that education is the most important investment for long-lasting and deep changes in society. Unlike planting rice or trees, which yield results in a year or a decade, educating children brings benefits that may take a century to fully manifest.</p>
         <p>This statement emphasizes the importance of education in shaping the future. People without education are like pens without ink, they lack the power to make an impact. Education builds our character, knowledge, and reputation in society. Without education, the dream of building a developed country remains just a castle in the air.</p>
         <p>If children receive quality education today, they will become responsible and skilled citizens who contribute to the nation's development and create a civilized society in the future. Therefore, investing in children's education is the best way to secure long-term progress and prosperity for the whole country.</p>
