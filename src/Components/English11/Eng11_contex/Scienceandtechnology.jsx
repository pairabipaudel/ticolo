        <h3>Comprehension</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer these questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Why did the author feel that she was lucky to be so naive of her freshman year at college?</p>
        <p>= The author felt lucky to be naïve during her first year of college because she didn't know much, and that helped her explore new things. Even though she made mistakes, those experiences helped her grow and learn. She feels that being unaware helped her find success in life later on.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. Why did she say that she went to college in the Stone Age?</p>
        <p>= She said she went to college in the Stone Age because, during her time, there was no internet or smart phones. When she sees her son using all kinds of gadgets and apps in college, she feels like her college life was old-fashioned and lacked modern technology.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. What kinds of technological tools can Hayden use at his college life unlike at his mother's time?</p>
        <p>= Hayden can use mobile phones with college apps, social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and even YouTube. These tools help him stay connected and make his college life easier, which his mom didn't have in her time.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. How has the internet and social sites affected the lifestyle of the youths?</p>
        <p>= The internet has made life easier for youths, but they now depend on it for everything. Instead of working hard or thinking deeply, they just search for answers online. Social sites help them stay in touch, but they don't really know each other in real life. They are missing out on real experiences and creativity.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. What things about college life will Hayden really miss unlike his mother?</p>
        <p>= Hayden might miss real conversations with people, using his own imagination, and discovering things by himself. His mom had those experiences, but Hayden may not because technology does most things for him.</p>
        <p className='question'>f. The writer says, "I worry that students today are more connected and more fragmented". Isn't this paradoxical? How?</p>
        <p>= Yes, it is a paradox. It sounds confusing at first. Being “connected” means they're always talking online, but “fragmented” means they feel lonely and not truly close. Even though they are chatting on social media, they don't really talk face-to-face or share deep feelings. So they are connected on the outside but disconnected on the inside.</p>

        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Do you think that advancements of technology can hinder the exposure students receive in school, and block them from gaining some of life's most memorable moments? Give reasons in support of your answer.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I think too much use of technology can sometimes stop students from enjoying real-life school experiences and memories. Even though technology is very helpful in learning, like using computers, internet, and online classes, it also has some downsides.
</p><p>
Today, most schools use laptops, tablets, and smart boards to teach. That sounds cool, but students often use these gadgets for other things like checking social media, watching videos, or playing games. Instead of paying attention in class, they get distracted. This way, they miss out on real learning and don't get the full experience of school life.
</p><p>
Also, in the past, teachers and students used to talk more face-to-face. But now, even teachers are using online apps and videos more than actual talking. Because of that, students might feel shy to ask questions or share their problems. Real conversations help students feel more connected and comfortable, but technology can sometimes take that away.
</p><p>
School life isn't just about studying. It's also about making friends, playing together, asking questions, and learning through fun. When students spend too much time on screens, they miss these beautiful moments. They miss group talks, outdoor games, and even the fun of sharing lunch.
</p><p>
So yes, while technology is useful, using it too much can block students from enjoying school life to the fullest. We should use technology wisely, but not forget the real joys of school that make it memorable forever.

        <p className='question'>b. Kline's essay focuses on the contrast between her son's freshman college experience and her own, but she also establishes what they have in common. Explain.</p>
        <p>= In the essay “Taking My Son to College, Where Technology Has Replaced Serendipity,” the writer talks about how her college life was very different from her son's. But even with all the differences, there are still some things that are the same.
</p><p>
She didn't have phones or internet when she went to college, but her son uses phones, apps, and social media. Even though the tools are different, they both had to go through the same feelings. Both of them felt nervous, excited, and unsure when starting college.
</p><p>
The writer made friends by meeting people face to face, while her son connects with people online. But they both had to find friends and build relationships in college. They both wanted to explore and learn new things, just in different ways.
</p><p>
So, even if the world has changed a lot with technology, the emotions, struggles, and experiences of college life are still the same for both of them.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Has the internet aided to broadening or narrowing the critical thinking capacity of youths or readers? How?</p>
        <p>= The internet is a big network that helps people get information from anywhere in the world. It has made learning easier and faster. But just like anything else, it has both good and bad sides.
</p><p>
If we use the internet to explore new ideas, learn facts, and understand things better, it helps us think more deeply. It can help us grow our minds and improve our critical thinking.
</p><p>
But if we always depend on the internet for quick answers and don't think for ourselves, it can stop us from being creative or solving problems on our own. Sometimes people just copy answers without trying to understand them, and that makes their thinking weaker.
</p><p>
So, the internet can either help or harm our thinking. It depends on how we use it. If we use it the right way, it's a great tool to improve our thinking skills. But if we only use it to take shortcuts, it can slow down our brain.</p>
