        <h3>Summary</h3>
      <p>Trifles is a short play by Susan Glaspell about a murder in a farmhouse. Mr. Wright has been found dead, strangled with a rope, and his wife, Mrs. Wright, is the main suspect. A group of people, including the sheriff, the county attorney, a neighbor named Mr. Hale, and their wives—Mrs. Peters and Mrs. Hale—come to the house to look for clues. The men search the house for big, clear evidence while the women stay in the kitchen.</p>
      <p>The men laugh at the women for noticing small things like the messy kitchen, a quilt with uneven stitches, and a broken birdcage. But the women slowly put the pieces together. They find a dead bird with its neck twisted, hidden in a box. They realize the bird must have been special to Mrs. Wright and that her husband likely killed it. The women understand that Mrs. Wright lived a lonely and unhappy life, and the bird's death may have made her feel hopeless. They believe this pain could have led her to kill her husband.</p>
      <p>In the end, the women decide not to tell the men what they found. They feel that the men wouldn't understand how badly Mrs. Wright was suffering because they don't see the value in the small “trifles” of a woman's life. The play shows how things that seem unimportant can tell a deeper story and how women often notice what men ignore. It also talks about justice and how sometimes people choose kindness over strict law.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. Do you believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband? Explain.</p>
        <p>= Yes, I believe that Mrs. Wright killed her husband. From the conversation between the two women, we learn that Mrs. Wright was a happy and lively woman before her marriage. She used to sing and enjoy life. But after marriage, her life became very lonely and sad. Her husband didn't allow her to sing or have visitors. She became quiet and depressed. The women also found a dead bird with its neck wrung, and they guessed that Mr. Wright killed the bird. That bird was probably her only friend and source of joy. So, as an act of revenge or out of deep sadness, Mrs. Wright may have killed her husband.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. Do you think Mr. Wright's death would have been uncovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home?</p>
        <p>= No, I don't think Mr. Wright's death would have been discovered if Mr. Hale hadn't stopped by the Wrights' home. The house was far from the main road, and they lived a very quiet and lonely life. If Mr. Hale hadn't visited, no one would have known what happened. There was no one nearby to check on them, and the news of Mr. Wright's death might have stayed hidden for a long time.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Why does Mrs.Hale think that Mrs. Wright's worries about her preserves indicate her innocence?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Hale thinks that Mrs. Wright's worries about her fruit preserves show that she might be innocent because only someone who didn't do anything wrong would worry about something so small. Mrs. Wright was more concerned about her jars of fruit breaking in the cold than about being in jail. Mrs. Hale believes that if Mrs. Wright had really killed her husband, she wouldn't care about something like fruit jars. This makes her think that Mrs. Wright didn't act like someone who was guilty.</p>
        
        <p className='question'>d. How does Mrs. Peters' homesteading experience connect her to Mrs. Wright?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Peters connects to Mrs. Wright through her own past experiences. She remembers feeling sad and alone when she lived in a remote place and lost her kitten. This helps her understand how lonely and hurt Mrs. Wright must have felt when her bird was killed. Even though Mrs. Peters is the sheriff's wife and is supposed to follow the law, she starts to feel sorry for Mrs. Wright. In the end, she helps hide the dead bird, which could have been used as proof against Mrs. Wright. So, her homesteading experience helps her relate to Mrs. Wright's pain and makes her act with kindness.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. How do the women's perspectives on men differ?</p>
        <p>= The women think that men are strong but also sometimes careless and lazy. They believe men have a lot of power but don't always use it wisely. On the other hand, women don't have much power like men, but they use their intelligence and understanding to deal with men and control situations in their own way.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. “MRS. HALE: Wright was close. …… she used to wear pretty clothes and be lively, when she was Minnie Foster, one of the town girls singing in the choir But that— oh, that was thirty years ago.”</p>
        <p>i. Why does Mrs. Hale refer to Mrs. Wright as “Minnie Foster”?</p>
        <p>= Mrs. Hale calls Mrs. Wright “Minnie Foster” because that was her name before marriage. Back then, she was young, cheerful, and loved singing in the choir.</p>

        <p>ii. What does her description tell you about Mrs. Wright?</p>
        <p>= This shows that Mrs. Wright (Minnie Foster) used to be happy, lively, and full of life before she got married. She liked wearing nice clothes and enjoyed music.</p>

        <p>iii. What does Mrs. Hale mean by “that was thirty years ago”?</p>
        <p>= When Mrs. Hale says “that was thirty years ago,” she means it has been a very long time since Mrs. Wright was happy and full of life. Marriage and her hard life have changed her.</p>

      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. What is the main theme of the play?</p>
        <p>= The main theme of the play Trifles is about gender roles, loneliness, and justice. In the play, the men think the women are only concerned with unimportant things, or "trifles," but the women notice small details that help them understand Mrs. Wright's sad life. Mrs. Wright, who used to be cheerful and sing in a choir, became quiet and lonely after marrying a strict and unkind husband. She lived in isolation with no one to talk to or enjoy life with. The women discover a dead bird, which shows that her husband might have killed it, and this made her feel even more broken inside. While the men want to punish her for killing her husband, the women understand her pain and hide the bird as a way of protecting her. This shows that justice is seen differently by men and women in the play.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. Discuss the symbolism used in the play.</p>
        <p>= Symbolism means using an object, word, or action to represent a deeper meaning or idea. In the play "Trifles," many small things (or “trifles”) in the house are used as symbols to show the unhappy life of Mrs. Wright. These symbols help the audience understand why she might have killed her husband. Here are some important symbols from the play:
</p><p>
The Preserves (Jars of Fruit):</p><p>
The jars of fruit that were frozen and broken represent Mrs. Wright's broken hopes and broken relationship with her husband. Just like the jars couldn't survive the cold, her marriage couldn't survive the lack of love and warmth.
</p><p>
The Singing Canary (Bird):</p><p>
The little bird symbolizes Mrs. Wright's happiness and lively spirit before she got married. She used to sing in the choir and was cheerful, but after her marriage, she lost her freedom and joy.
</p><p>
The Birdcage:</p><p>
The empty cage shows how Mrs. Wright was trapped in her life. Like a bird locked in a cage, she was stuck in a sad and lonely marriage, with no freedom to express herself.
</p><p>
The Dead Bird with a Wrung Neck:</p><p>
The dead bird with its neck twisted shows violence and pain. It is a symbol of what Mrs. Wright went through. Just like her bird, her spirit was killed. It also connects to how Mr. Wright was killed by being strangled with a rope, just like the bird.
</p><p>
The Quilt and the Knot:</p><p>
The quilt shows Mrs. Wright's attempt to do something normal, but the messy stitching in one part shows her nervousness and mental stress. The way she “knotted” the quilt is also a clue, it connects to how her husband was killed (with a rope around his neck). So, the knot has a double meaning: it shows both her stress and how the murder happened.</p>

            <p className='question'>e. Discuss the setting of the play. Does it have an impact on the theme of the play?</p>
            <p>= The play "Trifles" is set in Mr. John Wright's old farmhouse, which is located in a lonely and gloomy place, far from the main road and neighbors. This isolated rural setting plays an important role in the theme of the play. The house feels cold, quiet, and sad—just like Mrs. Wright's life. The distance from other people shows how alone she felt, especially after her marriage. She had no friends to talk to and no joy in her life. This loneliness and silence connect to the main themes of the play, like isolation, women's suffering, and lack of freedom. So, the setting is not just a background, it helps us understand why Mrs. Wright might have felt hopeless and why the small “trifles” the women notice are actually very important.

            <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
            <p className='question'>a. The credibility of a character is determined not only by the character's thoughts and actions but also by what other characters say and think about him or her. Discuss in relation to the characters of Trifles.</p>
            <p>= In the play Trifles, we learn about Mrs. Wright mostly through what others say about her. She doesn't appear on stage, but two women Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters talk about her life and help us understand her better. They remember how she was once a happy and cheerful person when she was known as Minnie Foster, who sang in a choir and wore bright clothes. But after marrying Mr. Wright, she became quiet, lonely, and sad. Her life became boring and cold because her husband didn't let her enjoy anything.
</p><p>
While the men in the play ignore small things in the kitchen, the women notice the broken jars, unfinished sewing, and the dead bird with a broken neck. These small things tell a big story. They show that Mrs. Wright lived a very hard and lonely life. She had no one to talk to, and even the bird that brought her joy was taken away from her. The women begin to understand her pain and feel sorry for her. They also realize that the way she killed her husband (with a rope) was similar to how the bird was killed—suggesting that she may have acted out of deep sadness and hurt.
</p><p>
So, even though Mrs. Wright never speaks in the play, we still understand her because of what others say about her. This helps us believe her character and feel sympathy for her.</p>

            <p className='question'>b. Dramatic irony occurs when the reader or audience has information that is unknown to the characters in a play; it creates tension and suspense. Analyse the play discussing the author's use of dramatic irony based on these questions:</p>
            <strong>(i) What information is crucial to the play Trifles?</strong>
            <p>= The most important information in this play is that Mrs. Wright killed her husband. This is not directly said at the beginning, but the women Mrs. Hale and Mrs. Peters slowly discover the truth while talking about Mrs. Wright's sad life. The audience learns this information before the male characters do. That's what makes it dramatic irony.</p>
            <strong>(ii) How does the playwright use this information to create dramatic irony?</strong>
            <p>= The playwright uses the conversations between the women to show clues like the broken birdcage, the dead bird, and the messy sewing. These “small things” are ignored by the men, but the women understand their deeper meaning. While the men look for “real” evidence upstairs, the women find the emotional and personal story downstairs. The audience sees how close the women get to the truth, while the men miss everything.</p>
            <strong>(iii) What effect does the dramatic irony have on the audience and on the play?</strong>
            <p>= Dramatic irony makes the play more exciting and thought-provoking. The audience feels smarter than the male characters because they understand what really happened. It builds suspense as we wait to see if the men will discover the truth. It also helps the audience feel more connected to the women and their point of view. This makes the play not just about a murder, but about how women's lives and struggles are often ignored.</p>
