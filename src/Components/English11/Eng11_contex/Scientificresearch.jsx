        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The essay talks about how scientific research is very important for the safety and future of humans. Even though scientists don't earn as much as doctors or businesspeople, they choose science because they enjoy learning and discovering new things. The writer says that the real reward in science is the excitement of discovery.
</p><p>
He shares a story from the Cold War in 1960, when he was invited to help solve a problem related to nuclear weapons testing. Countries like the USA, UK, and Russia wanted to stop testing bombs, but they worried that someone might test them secretly. As a seismologist, the writer helped find a way to detect secret underground tests by studying seismic waves, just like those from earthquakes. This shows how science can help protect the world.
</p><p>
The essay also explains that science helps in many areas, such as medicine, farming, technology, and energy. But humans still face many dangers, like natural disasters, pollution, war, and diseases. The writer believes that only science can provide real solutions to these problems.
</p><p>
In the end, he says that science is our best hope for staying safe and making life better for everyone.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>Answer the following questions.</p>
        <p className='question'>a. What does a scientist get instead of big money?</p>
        <p>= A scientist doesn't earn a lot of money like doctors or businesspeople, but instead, they get things like freedom to work, friendly relationships with other scientists (camaraderie), and independence. Most importantly, they get the joy of discovering new things, which is more valuable to them than money.</p>
        <p className='question'>b. What was the problem that the nuclear powers had faced?</p>
        <p>= The nuclear powers had agreed to stop testing nuclear weapons. But the problem was that if any country secretly tested a nuclear bomb underground, the others might not know about it. They needed a way to detect such secret tests to make sure no one broke the agreement.</p>
        <p className='question'>c. In which area did Keilis Borok's theoretical knowledge have a direct application?</p>
        <p>= Keilis Borok's theoretical knowledge was in seismic waves. As a seismologist, he could use this knowledge to detect underground nuclear explosions and earthquake tremors. His knowledge was directly useful in identifying secret nuclear tests, which helped in ensuring the safety and survival of humankind.</p>
        <p className='question'>d. What was the important decision that the politicians took before Geneva Summit?</p>
        <p>= Before the Geneva Summit, the politicians decided to ban nuclear weapons testing to protect humanity. They believed that if nuclear tests were stopped, countries would stop competing to make more powerful nuclear weapons. This decision was important for the safety and survival of all people.</p>
        <p className='question'>e. What are the natural and man-made disasters as mentioned by the author?</p>
        <p>= The natural disasters mentioned by the author are earthquakes, destruction of big cities caused by people, environmental disasters, and economic and social problems. The man-made disasters include things like the release of dangerous nuclear waste, large-scale violence, wars, and other problems caused by humans.</p>

        <h3>Reference to the context</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. The professional addressed as 'you' in the sentence “If you are clever, why are you so poor?” refers to a…</p><p className='question'>
i. lawyer ii. doctor iii. scientist iv. businessman.
Justify your choice.</p>
<p>= The word 'you' in the sentence “If you are clever, why are you so poor?” refers to a scientist. The author is talking about scientists because they are very smart and have a lot of knowledge, but they usually do not earn a lot of money compared to other professionals like lawyers, doctors, or businessmen. The author wants to ask why someone who is very clever would choose to be a scientist when they could make more money in other jobs.
</p><p>
The main point is that even though scientists are very intelligent and work hard, their job does not bring them as much wealth as other professions. Scientists often do their work for the love of science and discovery, not for money. The author uses this question to show that being smart does not always mean being rich. Scientists are respected for their knowledge, but they are not usually very wealthy. This is why the author is asking this question to a scientist.
</p><p>
So, the 'you' in the sentence clearly refers to a scientist because the sentence talks about clever people who are poor, which fits the situation of scientists better than lawyers, doctors, or businessmen.</p>

        <p className='question'>b. The writer says, “I found myself in Geneva.” What does it express?</p>
        <p>= The sentence “I found myself in Geneva” shows the writer's surprise and unexpected situation. It means that the writer did not plan to go to Geneva but suddenly got a call to attend an important meeting about nuclear weapons. He was invited quickly and unexpectedly, so he felt like he just suddenly found himself there without much preparation. This shows how important the meeting was and how quickly scientists had to act to help solve big problems.</p>

        <p className='question'>c. Are the following statements true? Why or why not? Discuss with your partner.</p>
        <strong>i. Money is more powerful than intellectual resources.</strong>
        <p>= This statement is not completely true. While money can give us some power, it cannot replace the value of knowledge, ideas, and understanding. Money can help us make changes in the lives of others by giving us resources, but it cannot give us the true desire or motivation to help. For example, money can buy us time to spend with family and friends, but it cannot give us the love, care, or connection we need to build strong relationships.
</p><p>
Sometimes, having too much money can even cause problems. It might make people feel unhappy, selfish, or lonely. They may try to escape from real life problems instead of facing them. So, having money alone does not guarantee happiness or success.
</p><p>
It is important to ask ourselves two questions: How much money do we really need? And what will it cost us to get that money? If we have less money than we need, or if we have to give up too much to get it, we will not feel truly happy.
</p><p>
In conclusion, money is important but it is not the most powerful thing. Intellectual resources like knowledge, creativity, and caring are much more valuable for true happiness and success in life.</p>
<strong>ii. Intellectual resources help survival of the mankind.</strong>
<p>= This statement is true because intellectual resources mean knowledge, ideas, and research that help us solve problems and improve life. Even though humans are not the strongest or fastest creatures on Earth, we are able to survive and protect ourselves because of our intelligence and the knowledge we have gained over time.
</p><p>
For example, because of science and research, we have been able to fight many diseases and improve our health. Without intellectual resources, people would still suffer from illnesses that are now curable.
</p><p>
Intellectual resources also help us find new sources of energy like solar power or wind energy, which are important to keep our world running in a clean and safe way. They help us discover new minerals and materials that are useful for technology and daily life.
</p><p>
Besides that, research and intelligence help us protect ourselves from threats like terrorism or natural disasters. With knowledge, we can develop better security systems and safety measures.
</p><p>
In short, intellectual resources are very important for the survival of mankind because they give us the tools and ideas to live safer, healthier, and better lives. Without them, surviving in this world would be very difficult.</p>
<strong>iii. Basic research is a way of stalling disasters.</strong>
<p>= This statement is true because basic research means studying and understanding the natural world and how things work. Scientists do this kind of research to learn more about earthquakes, tsunamis, storms, and other natural disasters. By studying these events carefully, scientists can find ways to predict when and where they might happen.
</p><p>
For example, by studying seismic waves, scientists can detect signs of earthquakes before they occur. This information helps people get ready and evacuate from dangerous areas, which can save many lives. Similarly, research about weather patterns can warn us about storms and floods in advance.
</p><p>
Because of this research, governments and organizations can prepare emergency plans, build safer buildings, and teach people how to protect themselves during disasters. All these actions help reduce the damage caused by natural disasters.
</p><p>
So, basic research is very important because it helps us understand disasters better and gives us time to act before they happen. This way, basic research helps slow down or even stop disasters from causing too much harm. It keeps people safe and saves lives.</p>

        <p className='question'>d. How does the essayist justify that scientific research is the humankind's survival?</p>
        <p>= The essayist explains that scientific research is very important for the survival of humans by sharing his own views and experiences. He is a seismologist, which means he studies seismic waves caused by earthquakes and underground explosions. His knowledge helped to detect secret underground nuclear tests, which was very important for protecting people from dangerous weapons. This shows how science can directly save lives and protect the world.
</p><p>
The essayist believes that science acts like a guardian or caretaker for humans. Scientific research helps solve many problems that people face. For example, science has helped us find new sources of energy like solar and wind power, new minerals to use in many ways, and medicines to cure diseases. Science also helps protect us from dangers like terrorism.
</p><p>
Moreover, scientific research can study natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and storms. Because of this, scientists can warn people before these disasters happen. This early warning gives people time to prepare and move to safe places, which saves many lives.
</p><p>
All these points lead the essayist to conclude that science is very important for the future of human beings. Scientific research gives us hope to survive and live better, even when faced with many challenges.</p>

        <p className='question'>e. What can be the purpose of the essayist of using quotations in the essay?</p>
        <p>= The essayist uses quotations in the essay to help explain and support the important ideas he wants to share with the readers. Quotations are words taken from other people, often experts or well-known figures, that can make the writer's points stronger and clearer.
</p><p>
Many people have wrong ideas or misunderstandings about science and scientists. Some think scientists are very rich or do things that are not useful. To show the real life of scientists and the true value of science, the essayist uses quotations. These quotations help the readers to better understand what science really means and why it is important.
</p><p>
By using quotations, the essayist makes his arguments more trustworthy and convincing. It also helps the readers to remember the main points more easily. Overall, quotations support the essayist's message and make the essay more interesting and clear.</p>

        <p className='question'>f. Discuss and illustrate the writer's stand that scientists are the most practical people in the world.</p>
        <p>= The writer believes that scientists are the most practical people in the world. By “practical,” he means that scientists work on real problems and create useful solutions that help people in everyday life. The writer explains that many important new technologies and products come from the work of scientists. These include medicines like antibiotics, electronics like computers and phones, new farming methods called the green revolution, and even new materials like synthetic fibers.
</p><p>
Scientists do research that leads to discoveries which improve our lives in many ways. For example, they help find new sources of energy so we don't run out of fuel. They also work on ways to protect us from dangers like terrorism. Scientists create better medicines that can cure diseases like cancer. They also develop new transportation systems that make it easier and faster for people to move around.
</p><p>
Because their work helps solve real problems and makes life better, the writer thinks scientists are very practical. They don't just think or imagine; they create things that people can use and rely on. This is why the writer calls scientists the most practical people in the world.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. Everyone lives under the fear of annihilation by nuclear weapons. Explain this statement.</p>
        <p>= Nuclear weapons are very dangerous. They can destroy a whole city in just a few seconds. When they explode, they kill many people right away, and even after the explosion, the harmful radiation stays in the air and makes people sick for years.
</p><p>
Even though some powerful countries like the USA, Russia, and the UK agreed to stop testing nuclear weapons, they still have a lot of them. If a war ever starts, these bombs could be used, and it would be a big disaster. People remember what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki during World War II so many people died, and the pain lasted a long time.
</p><p>
Today, the world is not always peaceful. Some leaders might make bad decisions, and countries like North Korea have tested nuclear bombs, which makes people even more worried. So, even though many people want peace, the fear of a nuclear war is always in the back of our minds. That's why we say everyone lives under the fear of being destroyed by nuclear weapons because if such a war ever happens, it could hurt or kill many people and change the world forever.</p>
     </div>
     <hr/>
     <div>
        <p className='question'>b. The essayist says 'While there is science, there is hope of survival and wellbeing for all of us.' Explain it.</p>
        <p>= The writer means that science gives us hope to live a safe and better life. Science helps protect us from dangers, both natural like earthquakes and man-made like wars and pollution. Thanks to science, countries have agreed not to test nuclear weapons secretly. Scientists can now tell the difference between an earthquake and a secret bomb test using their knowledge.
</p><p>
Science also helps us in our everyday lives. It gives us medicine, energy, clean water, food, and better ways to live. It helps us fight diseases, solve environmental problems, and protect ourselves from terrorism. Money alone can't solve big problems like natural disasters or global warming, but science can show us the right way.
</p><p>
So, the writer believes that as long as we keep trusting in science and supporting it, there is always hope for all of us to survive and live well.

        <p className='question'>c. Is science a blessing or a curse? Write an essay on it</p>
        <strong>Science - A Blessing or A Curse</strong>
        <p>Science is one of the most important parts of our lives. It has changed the way we live, work, and even think. In many ways, science is a great blessing. But at the same time, if not used wisely, it can also become harmful. So, science can be both a blessing and a curse depending on how we use it.
</p><p>
Science has made our lives easier and more comfortable. Electricity is one of its best gifts. With just a switch, we can light up a room, turn on a fan, watch TV, or cook food. We use machines to clean, wash, and do many household chores quickly. Factories, transport, communication almost everything depends on science.
</p><p>
In the field of health, science has saved many lives. Modern medicines and surgeries have helped cure diseases that once killed millions. Diseases like smallpox and cholera are now under control. The average human life is longer now because of science.
</p><p>
But science is not always a blessing. The same machines that make life easy have also taken away jobs. Many people are unemployed because machines now do the work of many hands. Science has also made deadly weapons like bombs and missiles that can destroy the world in seconds. Pollution, climate change, and unhealthy lifestyles are also the result of misuse of science.
</p><p>
In conclusion, science is a powerful tool. It can build or destroy, help or harm. It all depends on how we use it. We should use science in a smart and careful way—to improve our lives, not to hurt people or nature. If we respect science and use it for good, it will always be a blessing.</p>
