        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The poem "A Red, Red Rose" begins with the speaker expressing deep love for someone special. He compares his love to a beautiful red rose that has just bloomed. This shows that the love is fresh and full of excitement, like the start of a new relationship. But just like a rose can fade, the love might also seem like it won't last forever. Next, the speaker compares his love to a sweet and perfect melody. But again, music can go out of tune, just as roses can wither. At first, it feels like the speaker is describing a love that is strong now but might not stay strong forever.

However, the poem then takes a turn. The speaker promises that his love will last a very, very long time—longer than the seas stay full, longer than rocks stay solid, and even longer than life itself. He's saying that his love is not just temporary; it will last forever. In the final part, the speaker says goodbye to his beloved, as if he's going on a long journey. But he promises to come back, no matter how far he goes. This shows that his love is so strong that even time and distance can't break it. For him, true love is powerful and unchanging, even when life changes.</p>

        <p>d. Literary devices are tools that enable the writers to present their ideas, emotions, and feelings and also help the readers understand those more profound meanings. Analyze the poem in terms of the literary devices such as simile, symbolism, imagery, alliteration, and assonance.</p>
        <p>= The poet uses many literary devices to show how beautiful his love is and how strong his feelings are.

First, he uses similes to compare his beloved to a red rose and a sweet song, helping us understand his love better.

He also uses symbolism. The rose stands for love and beauty in the poem.

The poem has imagery, which means using words that create pictures in our minds. We can see the red rose and hear the sweet melody. The poet also uses strong images like seas drying up and rocks melting to show how long his love will last.

There is alliteration, which is the repeating of consonant sounds, like the /l/ and /r/ sounds in “red, red rose.”

And there is assonance, the repeating of vowel sounds, like the long /i/ sound in “And I will love thee still, my dear.”

All these tools make the poem beautiful and help us feel the deep love the speaker has.</p>

      <div>
        <p>e. What is hyperbole? Explain its purpose citing examples of hyperbole used in the poem.</p>
        <p>= Hyperbole is a way of exaggerating something to make it stronger or more important. It is not meant to be taken literally but to show strong feelings.

In the poem, the poet uses hyperbole in the line, “Till the seas gang dry” (until all the seas go dry). He means his love will last even longer than that, which is impossible, so it shows how powerful his love is.

Another example is, “And the rocks melt with the sun” (and the rocks melt in the sun). This is also an exaggeration to show that his love will never end, no matter what happens.

The poet uses these exaggerations to show how deeply he loves and how he wants that love to last forever.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>f. What is refrain? Why is it used in the poem? Explain citing an example from the poem.</p>
        <p>= A refrain is a line or group of lines that are repeated regularly in a poem. It helps to remind the reader about the main idea or feeling of the poem. It also adds rhythm and makes the poem more musical.

In “A Red, Red Rose,” the poet uses refrains in the second, third, and fourth stanzas. Some examples are:

1. “And I will love thee still, my dear”

2. “Till the seas gang dry”

3. “And fare thee weel”

These repeated lines help to emphasize the speaker's strong and lasting love and make the poem flow smoothly.

      <div>
        <p>b. Do you think that love has power? Why do the poets compose poems addressing their beloved?</p>
        <p>= Yes, I believe that love has great power. Love is one of the most powerful feelings in the world. It connects people, keeps them close, and gives them strength. Love can bring out the best in someone and make them do kind, brave, or even amazing things. But sometimes, love can also lead to pain or sadness if things go wrong.

Many poets write poems to their beloved because poetry is a beautiful way to express deep feelings. Poems can describe love in a sweet, emotional, and creative way. Writing about love in poetry often feels more special and powerful than saying it in simple words. That is why poets often use poems to show their love and emotions for the person they care about the most.</p>

      <div>
        <p>c. Poetry is the expression of feeling and emotions. Explain.</p>
        <p>= Poetry is a special way of expressing thoughts, feelings, and emotions. Many great literary works have been written in the form of poetry because it allows people to share what is in their hearts. Through poetry, a person can express love, happiness, sadness, pain, dreams, and even deep thoughts and ideas.

Poetry is not just about joy and beauty, it can also show grief, fear, anger, doubt, hope, and many other emotions. Poets use poetry to talk about their personal experiences, their hopes, and the things they feel strongly about. Poetry gives us a chance to connect with others by sharing emotions in a creative and powerful way. That's why poetry is called the true expression of human feelings and emotions.
