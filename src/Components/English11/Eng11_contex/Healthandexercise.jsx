        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What do you do you to keep yourself fit? What food do you avoid and why?</p>
        <p>= Fitness means being healthy and strong in both body and mind. To stay fit, I do regular exercise, drink plenty of water, and practice yoga to keep my mind calm and healthy. Drinking water helps my body work well, and yoga helps reduce stress and improve mental health.
</p><p>
I also avoid eating too much junk food because it is unhealthy. Junk food usually has a lot of sugar, fat, and salt, which can make me gain weight and feel tired. Foods I avoid include donuts, cakes, cookies, processed meats, and foods with hydrogenated oils because they have poor nutrition and can harm my body.
</p><p>
By exercising, eating less junk food, drinking water, and doing yoga, I stay healthy both physically and mentally.
</p>
<p>b. Healthy citizens are the greatest asset of a country. What can a state do to keep her citizen healthy?</p>
<p>= The success of any government is measured by the well-being of its citizens. Nothing is more important to a state than the health of its people. To keep citizens healthy, a state can do the following:</p>
<p>1. Provide proper healthcare facilities so people can get medical help when needed.</p>
<p>2. Focus on education because it helps maintain mental and social health.</p>
<p>3. Raise awareness about communicable diseases through advertisements and mass media.</p>
<p>4. Carry out proper vaccination programs to protect people from common diseases.</p>
