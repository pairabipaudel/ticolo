        <h3>Critical thinking</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. What do you do you to keep yourself fit? What food do you avoid and why?</p>
        <p>= Fitness means being healthy and strong in both body and mind. To stay fit, I do regular exercise, drink plenty of water, and practice yoga to keep my mind calm and healthy. Drinking water helps my body work well, and yoga helps reduce stress and improve mental health.
</p><p>
I also avoid eating too much junk food because it is unhealthy. Junk food usually has a lot of sugar, fat, and salt, which can make me gain weight and feel tired. Foods I avoid include donuts, cakes, cookies, processed meats, and foods with hydrogenated oils because they have poor nutrition and can harm my body.
</p><p>
By exercising, eating less junk food, drinking water, and doing yoga, I stay healthy both physically and mentally.
