        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>“An Astrologer's Day” is a thrilling and suspenseful story about a clever astrologer who spends his day tricking people and hiding from a guilty past. The story takes place in just one day in the life of this ordinary man who makes a living by pretending to predict people's futures. Many superstitious and trusting people come to him for advice, unaware that he is actually faking his knowledge.
</p><p>
The day starts normally for the astrologer, but everything changes when a mysterious man named Guru Nayak arrives. This meeting shocks the astrologer because Guru Nayak is someone from his past. It turns out they are from the same village and used to be friends until a serious fight tore them apart. In a moment of anger, the astrologer had tried to kill Guru Nayak and left him for dead in a well. However, Guru Nayak survived thanks to a passerby's help.
</p><p>
Now, fate brings them face to face. Guru Nayak demands answers and tests the astrologer's knowledge, refusing to leave without the truth. The astrologer, nervous but quick-witted, uses his cleverness to trick Guru Nayak by revealing personal details from the past, convincing him that he truly has supernatural insight. By doing so, the astrologer saves himself from danger.
</p><p>
The story ends with a surprise twist and shows how appearances can be misleading. It highlights the astrologer's intelligence and how he cleverly escapes the consequences of his past actions. R. K. Narayan masterfully builds tension and irony, making this a gripping tale about deception, fate, and survival.

The suspense grows when he meets the stranger, especially when he sees the stranger's face in the matchstick's flash and quickly refuses to accept the stranger's challenge. Finally, the story surprises us with the shocking truth that the astrologer was actually the one who stabbed the stranger years ago when he was drunk.

        <p className='question'>d. Description helps readers visualize what is happening in a story. What details and techniques does the author use to describe the astrologer?</p>
        <p>= The author uses vivid descriptions and clever techniques to bring the astrologer to life in the story.

The author shows how the astrologer uses appearance and clever talk to convince people he has special powers.
</p><p>
The writer also uses dialogue and third-person narration to show the astrologer's inner thoughts and fears, especially when he meets Guru Nayak, who could expose his dark past. Through this, we understand that the astrologer is not just a fraud but also a clever and brave survivor who made a new life after running away from his past.

        <p className='question'>e. Irony is a contrast between appearances and reality. What is ironic about Guru Nayak's meeting with the astrologer?</p>
        <p>= The irony in this story is that Guru Nayak is searching for the man who once tried to kill him, but without realizing it, he ends up asking that same man the astrologer for help. The astrologer, who had once stabbed Guru Nayak and left him for dead, now pretends to be a wise fortune-teller. He uses the information he already knows about Guru Nayak to act like a real astrologer and convince him that his enemy is already dead. This is ironic because Guru Nayak trusts and even pays the very person he wants to take revenge on, and in the end, the astrologer escapes punishment.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond the text</h3>
        <p className='question'>a. The astrologer attracts many customers in the street who are pleased and astonished by what he tells them. What does this tell you about the people of the town walking in the street?</p>
        <p>= The fact that the astrologer attracts many customers and surprises them with what he says shows that the people of the town are quite curious and trusting. Many of them seem to believe in fate, fortune-telling, and astrology. They are probably going through personal struggles, confusion, or difficulties in life, and they come to the astrologer hoping to find answers or comfort. This shows how deeply people depend on spiritual guidance, even if it's from a stranger.
</p><p>
It also shows that people can be easily influenced by appearances. The astrologer wears a saffron-colored turban, carries a sacred ash, and speaks with confidence. Even though he is not a real astrologer, his look and behavior make him seem like one. Because of this, the townspeople believe that he has special knowledge or powers. This tells us that the people judge based on outer appearance and are quick to believe what they see and hear, without questioning the truth.
</p><p>
So overall, this tells us that the people in the town are hopeful, superstitious, and sometimes even desperate to know about their future or solve their problems. They are drawn to people like the astrologer who seem wise and mysterious, especially when they are searching for guidance or hope in their lives.</p>
      </div>
      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>b. Why do most people want to know their future? Do you think astrologers can really help them know their future?</p>
        <p>= Most people want to know their future because they are curious, hopeful, and sometimes afraid. Life is full of uncertainties, and many people feel anxious about what lies ahead. They want to know if they will be successful, if they will have a happy life, if they will face big problems, or if they will be safe and healthy. People often turn to astrologers during hard times when they feel confused or when important decisions need to be made.
</p><p>
Some people also believe that knowing their future will help them avoid problems or prepare for them. For example, if someone hears that they may face bad luck, they might try to be more careful. Others look to astrology for hope and comfort—when life feels uncertain, even a small positive prediction can give them peace of mind.
</p><p>
As for whether astrologers can truly help people know their future, the answer depends. Some astrologers study real astrological systems and use calculations based on stars and planets. They may give helpful advice that seems accurate. But there are also many fake astrologers who pretend to know the future just to earn money. In the end, no one can fully predict the future with 100% certainty. Our actions, decisions, and hard work also shape what happens in our lives. So while astrology might guide some people or give them confidence, it's always best to rely on both effort and wisdom, not only on predictions.</p>

      <hr/>
      <div>
        <p className='question'>c. Is astrology a good practice of fortune telling or is it just a blind faith? Give reasons.</p>
        <p>= Astrology can be seen as both a helpful practice and, for some, a form of blind faith, depending on how it is approached. In many cultures, especially in Eastern countries, astrology is an important part of life. People often use astrology to guide important decisions like marriage, career, and health. It helps them find solutions and hope when they face problems or uncertainty.
</p><p>
Many people believe that astrology offers real insights because, in some cases, predictions have come true. These accurate prophecies make astrology more trustworthy for believers. Astrology studies the movement of stars and planets and connects them to human life, which some find meaningful and useful.
</p><p>
However, some people criticize astrology as blind faith because it relies on beliefs that cannot be scientifically proven. Some people follow astrology without questioning it or thinking critically, which can lead to wrong decisions. Blindly trusting astrology without using common sense or personal effort is not advisable.
</p><p>
In conclusion, astrology can be a good guide and a source of comfort for many people when used wisely. But it should not replace hard work, decision-making, and logical thinking. Astrology works best when it supports a person's choices rather than controls them blindly.</p>
