        <p>= In the story, the looking glass (mirror) symbolizes Nellie's desire for love and marriage, as well as her tendency to escape reality by imagining a romantic and idealized future.

        <p>b. Chekhov employs the magic trick in the story, using a very elegant transition from reality to imagination to reality sequence. Discuss its relevance to the life of young people.</p>

        <p>Chekhov's use of the seamless shift between reality and imagination in The Looking Glass reflects how young people often escape into dreams and fantasies to cope with their everyday lives. Just like Nellie imagines herself as a princess and her husband as a prince charming, young people frequently dramatize life and romanticize love, sometimes exaggerating their emotions and experiences. This fairy-tale quality mirrors how youth tend to see the world with heightened feelings and idealism.</p>

        <p>Additionally, the story shows that this tendency to blur reality and imagination is not limited to young people but is a part of human nature. Both young and old can become caught up in fantasies, especially in today's world where social media and sensational news often distort reality. Chekhov's elegant transition invites readers to understand the importance of balancing dreams with reality, a lesson particularly relevant for young people learning to face life's challenges.</p>
