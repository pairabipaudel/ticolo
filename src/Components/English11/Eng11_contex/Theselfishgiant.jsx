        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>The story begins with a group of children who used to play every afternoon in a beautiful garden that belonged to a Giant. The garden was very pretty, with green grass, colorful flowers, and fruit trees where birds sang sweet songs. Everything was peaceful and joyful.

One day, after being away for seven years, the Giant returned. He was angry to see the children in his garden and told them to leave. He built a big wall around the garden and put up a sign that said, “Trespassers will be prosecuted.” The children felt sad because they had no other place to play.

As time passed, spring arrived everywhere, but not in the Giant's garden. It stayed cold and covered in snow because there were no children, and even the birds didn't sing there anymore. The garden was always in winter, and it made the Giant's heart feel even colder.

Then one morning, the Giant heard a sweet song and saw that spring had finally come into his garden. He looked outside and saw that the children had found a small hole in the wall and were playing inside. Every tree was full of flowers and birds. But in one corner, it was still winter. A small boy was standing under a tree, trying to climb but couldn't reach the branches.

The Giant felt sorry and realized he had been selfish. He helped the boy up into the tree, and the tree bloomed right away. The boy smiled and kissed the Giant. From that day, the Giant broke down the wall and allowed all children to play freely.

Years later, the Giant grew old and weak. One winter morning, he saw the same boy under a golden tree with white flowers. The boy had wounds on his hands and feet, and the Giant became angry, thinking someone had hurt him. But the boy said those were the wounds of love. He invited the Giant to his own garden, which was in heaven. Later, the children found the Giant lying dead under the tree, covered in beautiful white blossoms.</p>

        <h3>Understanding the text</h3>
        <p>a. Where did the children use to play?</p>
        <p>= The children used to play in the Giant's garden every afternoon after they came back from school. The garden was very lovely and large, with soft green grass and many fruit trees. The birds would sing sweet songs while sitting on the branches, making the garden a happy and peaceful place for the children to enjoy.</p>
        <p>b. What did the Snow and the Frost do to the garden?</p>
        <p>= The Snow covered the garden's grass with a thick, white blanket, making everything look cold and quiet. At the same time, Frost decorated the trees with sparkling silver patterns, turning the whole garden into a frozen, icy place. Because of the snow and frost, the garden lost its warmth and beauty, and it felt like winter had taken over completely.</p>
        <p>c. What did the giant hear when he was lying awake in bed?</p>
        <p>= When the giant was lying awake in bed, he heard a beautiful and sweet music coming from outside. It was the sound of a linnet singing a lovely song. The music was so gentle and pleasant that it caught his attention and made him feel something he hadn't felt in a long time. This music helped him realize that spring was coming back to his garden, and it marked the beginning of a change in his heart.</p>
        <p>d. Why do you think spring season never came to the giant's garden?</p>
        <p>= I think the spring season never came to the giant's garden because the giant was selfish and cruel to the children. He didn't allow them to play in his garden and built a big wall to keep them out. Since the children were not there to bring joy and life, the garden stayed cold and lifeless like winter. The trees didn't blossom, the birds didn't sing, and the flowers didn't grow because the giant's selfishness stopped the natural happiness and warmth that children bring.</p>
        <p>e. How did the giant realise his mistake?</p>
        <p>= The giant realized his mistake when he noticed that his beautiful garden had become cold and empty. There was snow and frost everywhere, and no birds were singing. He understood that because he had stopped the children from playing in his garden, the garden had lost its life and happiness. When he heard sweet music and saw the children sneaking in through a little hole, he saw the garden coming back to life with blossoming trees and singing birds. Seeing this made him understand that his selfishness was causing the garden to stay in winter, and that the children were very important for the garden to be happy and alive.</p>

        <p>C. When the little child smiled at the Giant, and said to him, "You let me play once in your garden, today you shall come with me to my garden, which is Paradise," shortly afterwards, the happy giant dies. What is the coincidence of this event? Describe it in relation to this fairy story.</p>
        <p>= In the story, the little child who smiles at the Giant has wounds on his hands and feet, like the nail marks of Jesus Christ. This means the child is a symbol of Jesus, kindness, and love. When the child says he will take the Giant to his garden, which is Paradise, it means the Giant will be forgiven and welcomed into heaven because he learned to be kind and loving.

The coincidence in this event is that the child comes to the Giant only after the Giant shows kindness by letting him play in the garden. The child tells the Giant that now he will take him to a better place called Paradise, which means heaven. This shows that because the Giant changed his selfish ways and became loving, he is rewarded with happiness and peace at the end.

This moment in the story teaches us that forgiveness, love, and kindness bring true joy and a beautiful ending to life. It reminds us that sharing and caring for others is the most important thing for real happiness.</p>

      <div>
        <p>The story makes use of personification as one of the main figures of speech. Cite three examples of personification from the story. What is the significance of the seasons personified in the story?</p>
        <p>= Personification means giving human qualities to things that are not human, like objects or ideas. In the story, there are many examples of personification. Three examples are: the little flower that slips back into the garden after seeing the notice board, the snow and frost that seem to say spring has forgotten the garden, and the birds that stop singing because the children are not there.

The story uses the seasons as symbols to show what is happening in the Giant's garden. At first, the seasons are kind and bring nice weather because the children are playing happily. But when the Giant stops the children from coming, the spring leaves the garden, and winter stays with snow and frost. This shows that the Giant's selfishness has upset the natural balance. The seasons being personified help us understand that if someone is unkind or selfish, bad things will happen as a kind of punishment. So, the seasons teach us a lesson about being good and kind.</p>

        <p>C. This story can be read as a fairy story, where the children, the seasons, the tree, the corner of the garden, the snow, the wind and the frost are all used as symbolism. Interpret those symbols.</p>
        <p>= In the story, many things like the children, seasons, tree, corner of the garden, snow, wind, and frost are symbols that have deeper meanings. The children represent innocence, joy, and happiness because they bring life and love to the Giant's garden. The seasons symbolize the Giant's feelings, when the children are there, spring and summer bring warmth and flowers, but when the Giant is selfish and keeps the children away, winter stays with cold and snow, showing loneliness and sadness. The tree stands for life and hope, especially when it blossoms again after the Giant changes his heart. The corner of the garden where winter remains shows the part of the Giant that is still selfish. The snow, wind, and frost symbolize sadness and punishment because they reflect how the Giant's unkindness affects the garden and himself. Altogether, these symbols teach us that kindness and love bring happiness, while selfishness causes loneliness and sadness, reminding us to be kind and open-hearted.</p>

      <div>
        <p>D. Which figure of speech is used for 'winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail and little child'? Who is the little child compared to?</p>
        <p>= The figure of speech used for 'winter, frost, snow, north wind, hail, and little child' is personification because these things are given human qualities or actions in the story. For example, winter and frost act like they can make the garden cold and silent, and the little child can smile and speak.

The little child is compared to Jesus Christ, as he has wounds on his hands and feet like the nail marks of Jesus, symbolizing kindness, forgiveness, and love.</p>

        <h3>Reference beyond text</h3>
        <p>a. What is the main theme of the story?</p>
        <p>= The main theme of the story is about learning to be kind and caring instead of selfish. At first, the Giant was selfish and didn't want to share his garden with the children, so he built a wall and kept them out. Because of this, the garden stayed cold and lifeless spring never came. But one day, the Giant saw a little boy trying to climb a tree but couldn't reach it. The tree was also bending to help the boy. This kind and innocent moment touched the Giant's heart. He realized how selfish he had been and decided to break the wall and let the children play again. From then on, the garden became beautiful and full of joy. The story teaches us that being selfish brings loneliness, but when we show love and kindness, happiness returns to our lives.</p>
        <p>b. Does God punish those who are cruel to children and very selfish?</p>
        <p>= Yes, God punishes those who are cruel to children and very selfish. In the story, the Giant was very selfish and didn't allow children to play in his beautiful garden. Because of this, his garden became cold and lifeless. The spring didn't come, the birds stopped singing, and the flowers disappeared. The North Wind, frost, and snow stayed in his garden all year round. This shows that nature (a symbol of God's creation) turned against the Giant because of his selfishness. It was only after he realized his mistake, became kind, and let the children play again that the garden became full of life and joy. This teaches us that God or nature rewards kindness and love, and punishes selfishness and cruelty.</p>
